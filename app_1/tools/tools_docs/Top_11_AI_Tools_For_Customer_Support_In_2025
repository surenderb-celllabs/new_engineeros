## What are AI Customer Service Tools?
AI customer service tools are software platforms that combine natural-language processing, machine learning, and generative reasoning to interpret, answer, and anticipate customer questions.

## How do Generative AI & LLMs Transform Support?
Generative models can now write, summarize, and personalize in real-time, enabling "agentic AI" and autonomous workflows that can diagnose and resolve issues.
