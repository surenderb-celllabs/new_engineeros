#### Question
Are Phillips Hue products worth it? The pricing seems to be crazy.

I’m moving into a new apartment and was looking into some Hue products, like backlighting for my TV. For my TV size, it’s gonna cost me almost as much as a new TV for the backlighting to work (light strip, sync box, hub, etc.).

Amazon also suggested a Hue portable lamp which looked interesting. I checked the price: $160 for what looks like a mini lamp.

As far as I know, as for TV backlighting, Hue is the only brand that actually does what it claims. I doubt this applies to other smart lightning products though.

Are their products really that good where it’s worth the high price? As for smart lighting in general, is there another worthy brand out there that isn’t priced so high?

Thanks for the help.
