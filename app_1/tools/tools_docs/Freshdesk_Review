### Looking for feedback/opinions on Freshdesk

My company had a Freshdesk demo today. The platform seemed intuitive and nicely integrated but I haven't been able to find much "real world" feedback on it.

If you use Freshdesk or have experience with it, could you please provide some feedback on it?

* Does it work well overall? Is it reliable?
* Is customer service responsive when issues come up?
* Are you happy with the pricing for what you get?
* Does Freshdesk meet all your needs?

We are a small shop (about 11 people) and need a helpdesk platform to meet the needs of a potential new customer.

Any feedback is much appreciated!

Thank you
