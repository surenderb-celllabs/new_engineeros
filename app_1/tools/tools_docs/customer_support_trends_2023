As customer demands and behaviors continue to change at a breakneck pace, delivering top-notch support feels like more of a moving target than ever before. And yet, figuring out how to meet or exceed those expectations is crucial, with 88% of consumers saying the experience a company provides is equally as important as its products or services.

## Trend #1: Organizations will prioritize proactive support
We already briefly mentioned anticipating needs, and that’s exactly what proactive customer support is: identifying a customer’s potential concerns or questions and reaching out with assistance — before they ever have a chance to contact you.
* 62% of consumers admit that they think a company should be able to anticipate their needs effectively.
* Support leaders and teams will leverage advancements — particularly predictive analytics, which uses data, modeling, and machine learning to quite literally predict the future — to anticipate customers’ needs or challenges and get ahead of problems.

Your next steps:
* Reach out to a random sampling of your customer base with a simple, “Is there anything we can help with?” message.
* Review data for your existing support channels and your overall customer experience to see if you spot any commonalities.
* Include feedback forms on your website or send feedback forms after support interactions to get more customer insights.
* Use social listening to keep an ear to the ground on what customers are saying about your brand online.
* Connect with different teams throughout the organization — like product, marketing, and sales — to get their take on where customers could use more assistance.

## Trend #2: Customers will expect more self-serve support options
In our culture of instant gratification, your customers simply aren’t willing to wait for replies to their inquiries.
* 70% of customers say that they expect a customer service reply on the very same day.
* 13% of consumers expect brands to respond on social media within an hour.
* 81% of consumers expect more self-service options so they can find answers and information on their own.

Your next steps:
* Pinpoint a common roadblock or bottleneck, and identify what self-serve resources would best satisfy your customers’ needs.
* Consider self-serve options such as:
	+ Knowledge base
	+ Video tutorials
	+ AI-powered chatbots

## Trend #3: Artificial intelligence will take personalization to a new level
Artificial intelligence (AI) has been in the spotlight for a few years now, but the attention has really been kicked up a notch in recent months — and for good reason.
* AI can make your support team far more efficient and organized in plenty of meaningful ways, including:
	+ Automating routine and repetitive tasks
	+ Offloading basic and straightforward interactions to chatbots
	+ Making all of your complicated customer data more digestible and actionable
* Support teams can use machine learning and AI to gather and understand historical, behavioral, and social data and get a much more holistic understanding of customers.

Your next steps:
* Experiment with AI tools and features, such as:
	+ Forecasting models
	+ Analyzing email requests from customers and routing them to the best agents

## Trend #4: Support agents will play an even more crucial role
All of the talk about technological advancements — AI, predictive analytics, machine learning, and more — is enough to make people think that we’re one small step away from robots entirely replacing live agents.
* Qualtrics 2023 Global Consumer Trends Report states:
	+ A personable service agent has a bigger impact on consumer satisfaction than a short wait time.
	+ When a consumer talks to an empathetic agent, they are 5.2 times more likely to be happy with the overall experience than consumers who were not satisfied with how empathetic the agent was.

Your next steps:
* Get an understanding of when people crave or need human-to-human interactions and when people just want to get in, get an answer, and get out.
* Allow customers to select whether they want to pursue a self-serve option or be connected to a live agent.

## Trend #5: Support agents will become more intertwined in the entire organization
Good customer support is the backbone of any brand. It underscores quite literally everything else, so the lines between the customer support team and other departments are becoming increasingly blurry.
* Survey data from Hootsuite shows that:
	+ 32% of companies say the marketing team exclusively is responsible for providing customer service via social and messaging apps.
	+ Only 7% of companies say the customer service team is exclusively responsible
	+ In the majority of companies (58%), the marketing and customer service teams are working together to handle customer outreach through those channels.

Your next steps:
* Involve the marketing team (particularly social media team members) in customer support training sessions so they can benefit from that education.
* Create resources — like knowledge base articles, support videos, or even canned and templated responses — to support them.
* Identify and establish a process to efficiently and seamlessly move customers over to a support team member for more complex or sensitive interactions.
