# Top 6 AI Tools for Customer Support (with Examples of Outcomes)
Artificial intelligence (especially generative AI and agentic AI) is a natural fit for customer support, because so much of an agent’s day is spent talking to customers and solving problems. An AI tool can be a valuable resource with high capacity for understanding, responding to, and even anticipating human needs.

## Top 5 Uses for AI Tools in Customer Support
AI tools for customer support centers make it possible to handle higher volumes of queries more efficiently, which improves customer experience. Five important ways they do this are by:
* Handling repetitive tasks (like simple customer queries) or by drafting responses that agents can quickly use to free up time for resolving complex issues.
* Automatically surfacing the right response or policy during the call to support human agents in real time.
* Instantly generating call summaries and next steps to reduce the volume of after-call work.
* Automatically evaluating agents’ compliance with company regulations and highlighting coaching opportunities.
* Capturing and analyzing cross-channel conversations for an understanding of agent performance and query trends.

## What to Look for in AI-Powered Customer Support Tools
To lay the groundwork for a support system that not only scales, but improves over time, here are key features to keep in mind:
* Natural language understanding (NLU) is the foundation of any capable AI tool.
* Emotional intelligence: Look for tools that use call center voice analytics to accurately detect customer emotions and adapt accordingly.
* Robust and clear dashboards that show how well your support team is doing.
* Quick and effortless handoff to human agents, when needed.
* Integrations with internal tools.
