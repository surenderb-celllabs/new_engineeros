## Reviewing the top customer service software platforms used by successful support teams
Your customers need to be able to contact your business and receive a timely response. They may wish to ask a question about your product before making a purchase, follow up on an order, or solve a problem with a previous purchase. Addressing customers’ issues quickly and accurately is paramount if you want their continued business and to maintain the good reputation of your company.

## Contact center software comparison
Contact center software centralizes your communications with your customers. This category of support tool provides features including multichannel communication that lets you consolidate your interactions across voice/phone, email, chat, and social media into one location, call and chat routing so your agents receive enquiries based on their availability and specialty, and communication logging so you can inspect interactions and continually improve your processes.

## Ticketing and helpdesk support tools comparison
Ticketing and helpdesk software receives, stores, and organizes incoming service requests (referred to individually as tickets) and allows support teams to respond through a variety of communication channels. Customer support platforms in the helpdesk category should provide functions for ticket management so agents can see the status of enquiries and make sure everything is taken care of, workflow automation to reduce the number of repetitive tasks, and reporting and analytics so that you can measure the time it takes to respond and whether there are issues that are going unresolved.

Project management platforms are used internally to plan and track the implementation of projects — for example, to track training, process optimization, or knowledge base development.
