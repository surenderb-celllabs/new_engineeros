# 10 Energy-Efficient Lighting Systems for Sustainable Spaces
## Introduction
Lighting is an essential part of our daily lives, and it requires energy to provide artificial light. Current lighting systems create numerous issues for local and global sustainable development. Energy efficiency refers to the amount of energy needed to provide acceptable lighting. This article provides an overview of different energy-efficient lighting options for eco-friendly spaces.

## 1. LED Lighting
Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are emerging sustainable lighting solutions. LED lights are referred to as point source lights because they emit light from a small surface area, making it easier to regulate or direct light precisely in an LED lamp. LED luminaires cost less and last longer. They tend to use less energy than conventional standard bulbs, making them more energy efficient.

## 2. CFL Bulb
Compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) are another type of sustainable lighting source. CFLs, which replace inefficient incandescent lights, can save up to 80% on energy while lasting up to ten times as long. Large-source CFL bulbs are good for ambient lighting because they provide an even spread of light over broad regions.

## 3. Solar Powered Lights
Solar-powered lights are an energy-efficient choice for providing basic lighting services to off-grid communities. Solar-powered lights use sunshine to generate electricity, which is then used to illuminate places. Solar-powered lights provide numerous environmental benefits by replacing traditional kerosene lamps.

## 4. Smart Lighting Systems
Smart lighting systems use sensors and automation to adjust lighting levels based on various factors, including daylight availability and user preference. Energy savings can be as high as 35% when comparing smart lighting solutions to conventional lighting systems. Smart lighting systems can be used at a number of places, including the home, yard, offices, and streets.

## 5. Daylight Harvesting Systems
Daylight harvesting systems (DHS) save the most energy by integrating natural light with artificial lighting systems. DHS has an energy-saving potential of 20–60% as compared to non-dimmed conventional systems. DHS uses sensors to detect the level of illumination in natural light and automatically adjust artificial lighting accordingly.

## 6. Constant Illuminance Control Strategy
The Constant Illuminance Control Strategy (CICS) takes into account the age of the lighting system in the room. The continuous illuminance control technology uses a photocell to assess the illumination level in an area and anticipates its degeneration (ageing). The system’s automatically reduces the lumen output of the light sources, if the light level is too high.

## 7. Predicted Occupancy Control Strategy
The Predicted Occupancy Control Strategy (POCS) is used to control the lighting system’s operating hours. It saves energy by turning lights on and off based on a predetermined daily schedule, which frequently alters according to building occupancy.

## 8. Real Occupancy Control Strategy
The Real Occupancy Control Strategy (ROCS) adjusts the lighting system’s operation time based on space occupancy. In contrast to occupancy control, it does not adhere to a predetermined schedule. The technology detects when the room is occupied and being used and it automatically activates the lights.

## 9. Energy Efficient Fixtures
As the focus on lowering CO2 emissions develops, so does the emphasis on increasing the efficiency of energy-consuming and related fixtures. This is accomplished by establishing minimum product efficiency standards through law and Energy Star certification. Energy-efficient fixtures provide excellent performance while reducing energy use.

## 10. Task Lighting
Task lighting provides the appropriate light intensity for a specified work area where various processes (activities) must be completed, reducing the need for overhead lighting and saving energy and money. Task lighting is a popular method for providing light above ambient levels on office desks, countertops, and other work surfaces.
