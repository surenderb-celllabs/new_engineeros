# AI Summary Feature in BoldDesk
## Introduction to AI Summary
The AI Summary feature in BoldDesk uses artificial intelligence to generate concise summaries of:
* Tickets
* Chat conversations
* Knowledge base articles

This helps support agents quickly understand the context, customer intent, and emotional tone without reading full threads. AI Summary is accessible for integrated applications such as Facebook, WhatsApp, X (formerly Twitter), Instagram, and others, all of which are categorized as chat conversations.

## Accessibility of AI Summary
The AI Summary feature can only be used in the Agent Portal. Customers do not have access to this feature within the Customer Portal.
All summaries are generated in the language set in the Agent’s personal settings, regardless of whether the portal language differs from the Agent’s language.

## Use Cases for AI Summary
AI-generated summaries streamline workflows across various support scenarios:
| Use Case | Benefit |
| --- | --- |
| Agent Handover & Shift Transitions | New agents can quickly understand ongoing issues. |
| Managerial Oversight & Quality Assurance | Managers can audit and escalate cases efficiently. |
| Faster Ticket Resolution | Agents respond faster using summarized context. |
| Training & Onboarding | New team members learn from summarized content. |
| Sentiment & Intent Analysis | Helps prioritize support based on emotional tone and request type. |

## Enabling AI Summary
To use the Ticket Summary feature, ensure that AI Copilot is enabled and the Ticket Summary option is checked under AI Module > Settings. To disable it, simply uncheck the box under AI Copilot Features.

## Using AI for Summarizing Tickets and Chats
To use the summary feature for chats and tickets:
1. Open the ticket/chat in the Agent Portal.
2. Click on AI Prompt Actions.
3. Select the Summarize option from the dropdown.
