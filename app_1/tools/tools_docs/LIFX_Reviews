### Reviews
* **SHSharam**: Poor quality products and customer service. The bulbs are totally trash, they do not work occasionally, cannot reconnect them to the WiFi and basically useless.
* **Ashish Verma**: LIFX has completely fallen apart under Feit Electric. Support and reliability went straight off a cliff after Feit bought the company.
* **JGJames Golden**: Keep the tiny user manual forever or else? Moved around not sure where I placed my tiny little manual..  and so my $50 build is now useless unless I want ultra bright white light.
* **RORob**: Not recommended. Supported this company when it started added a good few bulbs over the years. But had to bin an equal amount, never worked to any degree without fiddling with the app etc.
* **BIBil**: Very difficult to set up. Lose connection for no reason, then will not set up again. Hate these bulbs. No support at all.
* **Warren Coakley**: I must express my disappointment with the recent experience regarding LIFX. As a long-standing and loyal supporter of the brand, I had high expectations for the service and quality associated with their products.
* **JJJ J**: Lightbulbs are extremely complicated to connect with a high failure rate. Bulbs are excessively complicated to connect, and often fail to connect at all.
* **Andrei**: Shocking to see poor reviews. Having purchased my first bulb at least 8 years ago, I’ve now got 5 and they all still work! 
* **AJAndy Jarvis**: Just changed my WiFi and now the ‘good’ Lifex bulbs won’t connect. If not sorted soon I will go elsewhere.
* **Shane Facchinello**: My experience with LIFX, now under Feit Electric, is a warning for any potential customer. After purchasing an expensive product, I found myself abandoned by the company when they stopped supplying essential power adapters.
* **JMJohn McIlveen**: Switches don't work. HUGE delay. Their support team totally has their heads burried in the sand and are trying to suggest it is a network error, which it is not.
* **James Brunette**: I was an early Lifx adopter. Most bulbs failed in the first two years. Some were replaced under warranty. I'm now throwing the rest away in order to drop the poor app.
* **THTony Hughes**: Great product horrendous customer service. Although LIFX are happy to sell their products in the UK they will no longer uphold the warranty as the original company went into liquidation and the brand was bought by a US company that will not support warranty claims.
* **STStrider**: Dreadful. Poor pick-up of WiFi, stuck on for no reason although the ap says still online, ap very hard to decipher.
* **Rick Schmutter**: Dont expect them to last past the warranty. Like a lot of other customers my Lifx light strip stopped working just outside the warranty period.
* **Joshua Bilboe Halliday**: I purchased two Lifx B22 smart lights, and they're fantastic, especially for someone like me who is deaf. They've really helped me wake up on time with their light schedule feature.
* **Austin Maier**: Get a Phillips Hue instead/save yourself the headache. have had my lifx light for about 3 years and have NEVER been able to keep it connected for more than 2 weeks.
* **Peter crookes**: Connectivity unreliable and left in the dark. So for two years the lights looked good,  we bought a z strip for my daughters bed,  there was connectivity problems throughout but we lived with those.
* **BIBill**: Try Another Brand. There is nothing intuitive about this app.  I recommend looking into other brands.
