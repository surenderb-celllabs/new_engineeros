# Alternatives to Smart Light Switches
Hello, 
In my last home, I installed a bunch of smart light switches. They weren't always the best solution and some of the wiring situations were funky and I never did figure them all out.
But the functionality of the ones that did work were great, because they did one thing that I consider a must: I could either talk to Alexa to turn on the light, or I could hit the switch. That "or" situation is the one thing I really want in a smart lighting solution...that it can act dumb or smart.
Now in a new place, I am looking for the same "OR" solution as described above but wondering if there are other alternatives. For example, I get a smart outlet plug and plug a light into it...but the wall outlet is triggered by the light switch. So that's a no go. Is there such a thing as a "branching" power cord where I could plug the light into both a switch-operated outlet and a smart outlet, so that one or the other works?How about smart bulbs...I have a ceiling light operated by a dumb switch. If I put a smart bulb in there, I imagine I could turn OFF the bulb while the switch is on, but obviously I'd need the switch to be on in order to have the bulb operate.
I hope I'm making sense. I can't figure out how to word these situations in order to google them! Basically, what solutions exist to get smart light switch operability without actually installing the smart light switches?
