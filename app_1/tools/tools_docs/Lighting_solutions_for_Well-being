# See well-being in a new light
Transform your lighting into a well-being solution with Signify Lighting for Well-being — a portfolio of lighting solutions designed to help people see well, feel well, and perform well.

# The pandemic changed the workplace for good
It’s time for healthy multipurpose spaces that promote well-being and protect the environment.

# What is Lighting for Well-being
Lighting helps us visually to see well, physically to perform well and emotionally to feel well. That means light isn’t just for seeing, but something we actively feel through our circadian rhythm, the quality of our sleep, our hormones, our cognitive performance and our memory.

# Build Well
With Signify Lighting for Well-being, you can build a space that supports today’s demand for adaptable, multi-purpose workspaces with ‘standout’ commercial appeal.

# See Well
Personalize the workplace lighting to support individual eyesight or tasks with luminaires that provide comfortable illumination and support prolonged vision during the day.

# Feel Well
Create nature-inspired lighting to boost mood with lights that mimic the natural patterns of daylight. Reassure occupants with UV-C disinfection lighting that disinfect air and surfaces.

# Perform Well
Help everyone thrive at work with the right light at the right time during the day to increase daytime alertness, facilitate concentration and evoke engagement.
