# Philips Hue Essential Review
## Great Value Smart Lights that are Almost as Good as the Originals
The Philips Hue Essential series is a great entry-level range of smart lights that is fully compatible with other Hue devices. The bulbs work brilliantly in most situations, offering fantastic value and an excellent way to start a Hue setup or extend an existing one without breaking the bank.

## Key Features
* Much more affordable than regular Philips Hue lights
* Very good color reproduction
* Fully compatible with Philips Hue app and accessories
* All Essential bulbs offer tuneable white and colored light

## Pros and Cons
### Pros
+ Much more affordable than regular Philips Hue lights
+ Very good color reproduction
+ Fully compatible with Philips Hue app and accessories
+ All Essential bulbs offer tuneable white and colored light
### Cons
- Dimmable to 2% brightness, compared to 0.2% for a regular Philips Hue bulb
- Only three bulb types available
- Darker 'halo' sometimes visible around top of bulb

## Performance
The Philips Hue Essential bulb's color reproduction was impressive, and during most tests, it was difficult to spot any difference between the Essential bulb and a standard Philips Hue White & Color Ambiance bulb. However, the Essential bulb can only be dimmed to 2% of its maximum brightness, whereas the regular bulb can drop to just 0.2%.

## Price and Availability
The Philips Hue Essential range is designed to be an accessible entry point into the world of smart lighting, with the bulbs coming in at a much cheaper price than standard Philips Hue ones. One Philips Hue Essential bulb costs $24.99 / £19.99 (about AU$40), and multipacks are available for added savings.

## Design
Philips offers only a small selection of Hue Essential bulbs, which makes sense for an entry-level option. There are currently three models available – screw, bayonet, and GU10 spotlights – and these should be fine for most fittings around your home. All bulbs in the Philips Hue Essential Series are "Warm to Cool White & Color", meaning they can show eight million colours, plus white light at different temperatures.

## Should You Buy Philips Hue Essential Bulbs?
Buy them if:
* The price of regular Hue lights is off-putting
* You want to extend your Hue setup into more rooms
Don't buy them if:
* You want to create subtle ambience
* You already have regular Hue bulbs in your room

## Alternative Options
* Govee Wi-Fi LED Bulb
* Nanoleaf Matter Essentials

## Testing and Conclusion
The Philips Hue Essential bulbs were tested alongside a standard Philips Hue White & Color Ambiance bulb, and the results show that they offer great value and performance, despite some limitations. With their affordable price and excellent color reproduction, the Philips Hue Essential bulbs are an excellent option for those looking to start or extend their smart lighting system.
