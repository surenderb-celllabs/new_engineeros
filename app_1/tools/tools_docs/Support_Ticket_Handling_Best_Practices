Be it service providers, start-ups, or well-established organizations, staying on top of customer support services is critical for all of them. It is essential for customer retention.

## The Importance of Ticket Management
Most organizations have to manage a regular influx of customer support requests. Only a well-planned ticket management system can keep your support up and running. A digital system centralizes communication for end-users and streamlines the work of support agents.

## 11 Ticket Handling Best Practices
