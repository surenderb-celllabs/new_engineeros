# Circadian Lighting
Energize, relax, and perform

Sunlight-inspired Indoor lighting gives you the energy you need to live a good, comfortable life every day.

Circadian lighting from Signify brings the experience and benefits of natural sunlight indoors, supporting performance, comfort, and well-being in classrooms, workspaces, and healthcare facilities.

Light is essential for vision, and for experiencing and responding to the world around us. But did you know that light plays an important role in regulating sleep, moods, behavior, and performance, and mental health?

This is the circadian, or biological, function of light. Whether we’re aware of it or not, the light we take in throughout the day plays a key role in determining our physical and mental well-being.

## Spotlight Episode 1 | Light, Sleep, Speed, Repeat
For Mercedes-AMG PETRONAS F1 Team champion George Russell and his performance coach Aleix Casanovas, light is the number one way to adjust circadian rhythms, overcome jet lag, and elevate performance.

## Spotlight Episode 2 | Let there Be Light
How does driver Kimi Antonelli stay focused in the high-pressure environment of Formula One racing? Discover how Signify circadian lighting opens up his racing mindset and helps him perform at his best.

Stepping out of biological darkness

With connected lighting and dimming controls, we can optimize the color of the light based on time of day to replicate the body's natural rhythms, helping to avoid disruptions to our circadian cycle.

On average, people spend more than 90% of their time indoors, and many students and office workers spend 36% of that time in a classroom or workplace. Patients in healthcare facilities and elderly people with limited mobility can spend up to 100% of their time indoors.

The light that you experience throughout the day affects your circadian cycle, through both visual and non-visual receptors in the eyes. You need different kinds and quantities of light throughout the day to sleep well and to feel well and perform at your best when you’re awake. Specifically, you need brighter, bluer light in the morning and dimmer light with less or no blue in it in the evenings.

Signify has been at the forefront of circadian lighting since the discovery of the third non-visual photoreceptor that governs human biological rhythms in the late 1990s. Circadian lighting from Signify is task adaptable and flexible depending on the needs of different people in different situations, from students in classrooms to patients and staff in healthcare environments to employees in professional workspaces. Circadian solutions from Signify offer the high quality, reliability, and design excellence which has been our hallmark for over 125 years.

## Our circadian lighting solutions
Circadian lighting from Signify uses a combination of dynamic LED luminaires, flexible controls, and science-based lighting recipes or experiences to deliver the right kind and quality of light for the optimum biological impact throughout the day.

* Signify NatureConnect: Brings natural daylight indoors. The blue-sky effect mimics daylight, boosts energy, and improves workspaces.
* Philips BioUp: Enhances the LED spectrum with cyan light, supporting biological health without changing the visual color or intensity of light.
* Tunable LED luminaires: Allow biologically effective adjustments to light color and intensity throughout the day.
* Signify Interact: Connected systems use tunable LED luminaires and evidence-based lighting recipes to support mood, performance, and overall well-being.
* Philips Dynalite: Lighting controls can adjust lighting levels dynamically depending on task, time of day, and other factors.
* Color Kinetics: OneSpace LED lights with textiles create a ceiling surface that delivers high-quality, uniform white light for an enhanced daylight experience.
