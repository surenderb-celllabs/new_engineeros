# Circadian Lighting and Lighting Controls: a Simple Overview
## Introduction to Circadian Rhythm
The circadian rhythm is a biological cycle that keeps the body 'on schedule' throughout the day and night. A critical part of the circadian rhythm is how human physiology reacts to light and the brightness of its surroundings. The body's 'master clock' regulates various functions and processes based on this reaction to light, such as hormone production, hunger, alertness, and body temperature.

## What is Circadian Lighting?
Circadian lighting is lighting that supports the circadian rhythm and psychological health through a combination of natural and artificial light sources. It involves providing the appropriate intensity and spectrum of light throughout different points of the day. Setting up circadian lighting can be challenging, as people have different working hours, rhythms, and needs, and may require differing lighting configurations.

## How Do We React to Circadian Lighting?
In addition to rod and cone cells, the eye contains other light-sensitive receptors linked with mental alertness. The spectral sensitivity of these receptors differs from that of cone cells, with a peak sensitivity in bluer, colder light at about 470nm. This means that alertness responds not only to the intensity of light but also to the color temperature. Exposure to light can increase alertness, and powerful bluish morning light can suppress the production of melatonin, supporting the production of cortisol and serotonin.

## Circadian Lighting and Human Centric Lighting — What's the Difference?
Closely related to circadian lighting is the concept of Human Centric Lighting (HCL), which supports health, well-being, and performance through visual, biological, and emotional benefits of light. Although both terms share similarities, HCL has a broader focus, taking into account additional lighting design elements that have impacts beyond the circadian rhythm. Integrative Lighting refers to lighting specifically designed to produce a beneficial physiological and/or psychological effect upon humans.

### Comparison of Concepts
* **Human Centric Lighting (HCL)**: Supports health, wellbeing, and performance of humans by combining visual, biological, and emotional benefits of light.
* **Integrative Lighting**: Lighting specifically designed to produce a beneficial physiological and/or psychological effect upon humans.
* **Circadian Lighting**: Supports circadian and psychological health through artificial lighting & indoor daylight exposure and outdoor views.

## The Importance of Circadian Lighting
### Health Benefits
Proper lighting can have a significant impact on sleep, mood, and general wellbeing. Blue wavelengths can disrupt the secretion of melatonin, disrupting sleeping patterns. Circadian lighting is particularly important in areas such as healthcare and hospitality.

### Productivity Benefits
Circadian lighting can also impact alertness during working hours. Intelligent lighting control systems can help set up the right light at the right time and place, reducing stress levels and complementing circadian rhythms.

### Achieving Building Standards
The WELL Building Standard acts as a benchmark for optimal building performance, focused on spaces that benefit occupant health and wellbeing. Achieving such standards means creating a truly sustainable and people-focused space.

## Case Studies
* **Vasakronan Head Office – Sweden**: Different lighting schedules were programmed to follow the rhythm of natural light, creating circadian benefits for everyone in the space.
* **SEB Bank HQ – Lithuania**: The lighting concept was closely coordinated with interior design elements to create a unique mood with a strong focus on wellbeing.
