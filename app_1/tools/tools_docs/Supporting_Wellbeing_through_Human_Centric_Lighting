# Supporting Wellbeing through Human-Centric Lighting
## Introduction
The lighting in our indoor environments plays a crucial role in how we feel, think, and perform. Whether we’re working, learning, or relaxing, lighting should be designed to support people, not just to illuminate spaces. With intelligent lighting controls, it’s possible to create environments that actively promote wellbeing.

## What is Human-Centric Lighting?
Human-Centric Lighting is lighting that supports the health, wellbeing and performance of people by combining the visual, biological and emotional benefits of light. As human beings, we’ve evolved over many years with a single daylight source – the sun. This natural daylight cycle helps regulate our circadian rhythm, which governs our sleep–wake cycle and affects everything from alertness to hormone production.

## Human-Centric Lighting vs Circadian Lighting
Closely related to human-centric lighting is the concept of circadian lighting. Circadian lighting specifically aims to support our body’s internal clock through lighting that mimics natural daylight exposure. It focuses on biological and psychological health, typically by adjusting brightness and colour temperature in sync with the day–night cycle. Human-centric lighting, while it includes circadian support, goes beyond by also considering the emotional and visual comfort of occupants.

## The Benefits of Human-Centric Lighting
* Better Wellbeing: Light has a direct impact on how we feel, and aligning it with our biological needs helps create more comfortable and supportive environments.
* Improved Sleep Quality: Human-centric lighting has been shown to positively influence sleep duration, quality, and timing.
* Productivity and Focus: Better lighting means better visual comfort, helping to improve concentration and performance.

## How Human-Centric Lighting affects different environments
* Workplaces: Poor lighting can lead to eye strain, fatigue, and low morale, all of which affect performance and wellbeing.
* Education: Lighting that responds to different times of day and activities can help maintain student attention and improve outcomes.
* Healthcare: Lighting is a critical factor in healthcare settings, not just for visibility, but for comfort, recovery, and staff performance.
* Other Applications: The benefits of human-centric lighting are not limited to offices, schools or hospitals. Wherever people spend time, lighting plays a role in how they feel and how they function.

## Aligning with Global Wellbeing Standards
The benefits of human-centric lighting are also recognised by standards such as the WELL Building Standard, developed by the International WELL Building Institute. This global framework measures how buildings support health and wellbeing, with lighting as one of its 10 core concepts.
