# Blue Light Has a Dark Side
## Introduction to Blue Light
Blue light has a significant impact on our sleep and overall health. Although it is environmentally friendly, exposure to blue light can affect our sleep patterns and potentially lead to various diseases.

## What is Blue Light?
Not all colors of light have the same effect on our bodies. Blue wavelengths, which are beneficial during the day as they boost attention, reaction times, and mood, seem to be the most disruptive at night. The proliferation of electronics with screens and energy-efficient lighting has increased our exposure to blue wavelengths, especially after sundown.

## Light and Sleep
Everyone has a unique circadian rhythm, with an average length of 24 and one-quarter hours. The circadian rhythm of people who stay up late is slightly longer, while those of earlier risers are shorter. Daylight helps keep our internal clock aligned with the environment.

## Is Nighttime Light Exposure Bad?
Some studies suggest a link between nighttime light exposure and an increased risk of diabetes, heart disease, and obesity. Exposure to light at night suppresses the secretion of melatonin, a hormone that influences our circadian rhythms. Even dim light can interfere with our circadian rhythm and melatonin secretion.

## Effects of Blue Light on Sleep
While any kind of light can suppress melatonin secretion, blue light at night does so more powerfully. Harvard researchers found that blue light suppressed melatonin for about twice as long as green light and shifted circadian rhythms by twice as much.

## LED Blue Light Exposure
If blue light has adverse health effects, then environmental concerns and the quest for energy-efficient lighting may be at odds with personal health. LED lights, although more efficient, produce a fair amount of blue light.

## Protecting Yourself from Blue Light at Night
To minimize the effects of blue light, consider the following:
* Use dim red lights for night lights, as red light is less likely to shift circadian rhythm and suppress melatonin.
* Avoid looking at bright screens beginning two to three hours before bed.
* Wear blue-blocking glasses or install an app that filters blue/green wavelengths at night if you work a night shift or use electronic devices extensively.
* Expose yourself to bright light during the day to boost your ability to sleep at night and improve your mood and alertness during the day.
