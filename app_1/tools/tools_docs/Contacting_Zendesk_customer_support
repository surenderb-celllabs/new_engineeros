# Contacting Zendesk Customer Support
## How do I get help from Zendesk?
You have options when you need help from the Zendesk team. Pick the option that works best for you.

### Options for Getting Help
* **Option 1: Use the widget**
* **Option 2: Submit a request via web form**
* **Option 3: Call us**

## Option 1: Use the widget
For the best experience using our widget, sign in to your own Zendesk subdomain or here, on the Zendesk help center. Once you're signed in, you'll get personalized answers and access any unique entitlements you have with Zendesk customer support.

To use the widget:
1. In your Zendesk account, click your profile avatar in the upper right-hand corner
2. Click **Get help**
3. Zea (formerly Z Bot), an AI agent, will greet you. Zea is trained to provide answers and even automatically resolve many common issues, but if your issue doesn't call for self-service resolution, request a human agent via messaging or a callback at any time.
4. Zea may ask you a few more questions to help route your conversation to the right person.
5. If you've opted to connect via messaging, an agent will join the conversation. If you've requested a callback, we will call you at the number provided.

## Option 2: Submit a request
You must be signed in to the Zendesk help center to access the web form and submit a request.

To access the web form:
1. Sign in to the Zendesk help center by clicking **Sign in** in the upper right hand corner of this webpage
2. Select **Submit a request** from your profile menu
3. Choose the **Customer support request form** and fill in the fields with your details and information.
4. Zendesk customer support will review your new request and reply through email.
5. Read and reply to our updates through your inbox, or view and manage the request in the Help Center under **My activities > Requests**

## Option 3: Call us
Call our US toll free number, **1-888-851-9456**, which is staffed from 8am-6pm Eastern Time, Monday through Friday (excluding holidays).

**Note:** It's essential to always open a new request or conversation when you need help on a new or separate issue. That way, we can immediately route your request to the right team to support you.
