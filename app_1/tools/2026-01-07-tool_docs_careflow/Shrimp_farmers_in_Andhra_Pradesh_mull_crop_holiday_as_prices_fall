# Shrimp Farmers in Andhra Pradesh Mull Crop Holiday as Prices Fall
Shrimp farmers in Prakasam and Nellore districts have decided to go for a crop holiday if exporters fail to lift their produce in the next 15 days at the prices agreed upon by them before the Empowered Committee constituted by the Andhra Pradesh government.

## Reasons for the Decision
* Falling price of shrimp has taken a toll on their business
* Exporters are adopting a 'go slow' approach, leaving the shrimp farmers in the lurch
* Farmers are forced to sell their produce to middlemen at a price less than ₹20 per kg for various counts

## Farmer's Concerns
* "I raised shrimp with a hope for the price for a count of 100 above ₹300 per kg. But the price has fallen below ₹200 per kg mark. I have decided not to raise fresh crop in coming February," said K. Venkateswara Rao, a farmer from the coastal Tangutur mandal.
* "Though the farmers will not be able to achieve the break-even if the price rules below ₹270 per kg, we accepted during the review of the prices by the Committee earlier this month to avoid uncertainty. But the agreement is hardly followed," said Shrimp Farmers' Association Prakasam district unit convener Duggineni Gopinath.

## Exporter's Role
* Exporters are driving down the prices of Litopenaeus vannamei shrimp on the pretext of excess production in Equador
* Exporters in Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam are getting a price between ₹290 and ₹310 for 100 counts of white leg shrimp

## Government's Response
* Andhra Pradesh State Aquaculture Development Authority (APSADA) Vice-Chairman V.Raghuram said he would draw the attention of Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy to their woes
* The government could be expected to announce subsidized power for shrimp farmers in non-aqua zones

## Power Subsidy
* Shrimp farmers complained that they would be forced to incur losses with electricity costing ₹3.85 per unit
* Many units fell outside the aqua zones

## Promise of Support
* YSRCP MP Beeda Mastan Rao, a leading player in the aqua sector, promised to coordinate with the exporters and ensure lifting of 30 tonnes to 40 tonnes of shrimp each day from the region.
