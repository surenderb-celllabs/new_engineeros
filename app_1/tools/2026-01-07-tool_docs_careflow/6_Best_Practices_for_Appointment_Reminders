# 6 Best Practices for Appointment Reminders
Businesses often lose clients to missed appointments and cancellations. These issues can lead to a loss of business opportunities and revenue. An online booking system can help you avoid these problems and streamline your scheduling process through automated appointment reminder services.

Automated appointment reminders are SMS texts, email reminders, or voice calls that you can send to your clients. You can send an automated appointment confirmation text after booking and an appointment reminder a few days or hours before your client’s visit. With the client’s consent, you can also send updates or reminders about upcoming events.

Calling or sending manual message reminders to each client can be extremely time-consuming and inefficient. Moreover, if a client cancels or reschedules the appointment, adjusting bookings and managing availability can be a pain. Missed patient appointments or no-shows can mess up your work schedule.

They reduce no-shows or missed appointments. With automated reminders, you can plan and schedule your calendar better.

They allow clients to directly contact you and make appointment changes. With automated reminders, your administrative staff can easily manage availability and bookings in real time. This can also prevent issues like double bookings.

In sum, automated appointment reminders are a quick and effective way to interact and engage with clients, maintain client relationships, and improve client experience. With reduced no-shows and cancellations, your business can reach more clients and grow.

## Best Practices for Appointment Reminders
If you use appointment reminders daily, here are some best practices that can help you and your clients.

1. **Send Automated Reminders for Upcoming Appointments**
Calling or sending manual text messages or email appointment reminders can be a waste of time. But appointment reminders are essential to avoid missed or late appointments.
With automated reminders, you no longer need to worry about no-shows or last-minute cancellations. Automated reminders for upcoming appointments are sent as timely email or text reminders. You can send these a few days or hours before the scheduled date or time to ensure that your clients don’t miss their time slot. They save your administrative staff time and energy and allow your business to run smoothly without schedule disruptions.

2. **Use Both Text Messages and Email Reminders**
To make sure your clients never miss an appointment, it’s best to send appointment reminders by email and text messages. Different clients may have different preferences for communication with your business. Some clients prefer text appointment reminders, whereas some prefer communication via email reminders.
While email appointment reminders can be effective, reminder text messages may be a quicker way to reach your clients. Nowadays, most people carry their phones everywhere and are more likely to read reminder messages than emails.
However, businesses should send both text and email reminders. It increases the chances of your clients reading the notification and remembering the appointment. If they don’t miss a reminder, they won’t miss the appointment. It can also help you get enough notice if a client decides to cancel or reschedule.

3. **Send Different Reminder Types for Different Appointment Types**
Automated reminders can be sent as emails, texts, and voice calls. However, you can send different reminder types for different types of appointments.
Automated reminder software allows you to choose from different templates and customize your reminders. For example, you can send a reminder a day before the appointment telling the client what they need to bring. You can also send a reminder for a follow-up appointment, along with the date and time.
You can also control the frequency of reminders and whether you want to send email, text, or voice reminders. This ensures that all your clients get specific and personalized notifications for their upcoming appointments.

4. **Request Appointment Confirmation**
When a client books an appointment with you, make sure to send them a confirmation text or email. Requesting appointment confirmation can help you reduce no-shows and last-minute cancellations. You can get quick client responses, better manage your bookings, and plan your business schedule accordingly.
Your appointment confirmation text or email can include the details of the appointment, such as the date and time. You may include details of what the client needs to bring with them. Be sure to include the cancellation policy. Also provide the client with options to cancel or reschedule the appointment and contact you.

5. **Integrate Appointment Reminders Into Online Booking**
Integrating appointment reminders into your online booking system can help you schedule appointments more efficiently. They come with a booking calendar that allows clients to schedule their appointments. The integrated system updates booking dates and availability in real time.
You can integrate your calendar with appointment reminders. You can also choose from a variety of templates and set different reminder types for different appointments.

6. **Send Reminders an Hour Before Appointments to Decrease Late Arrivals**
