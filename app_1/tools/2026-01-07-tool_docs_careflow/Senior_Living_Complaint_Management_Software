## How It Works: From Resident Request to Resolved Issue
### Can I track resident complaints with Issuetrak?
Yes, absolutely. Issuetrak was built for this. You can track every type of resident complaint or request—from a maintenance issue in an apartment to a concern about dining services. Each complaint is logged as a ticket, creating a single source of truth that helps your team stay organized. The system tracks the issue from submission to resolution, providing a clear, timestamped audit trail.

### How does Issuetrak help with resident complaint management?
Issuetrak centralizes and streamlines your entire complaint management process. Instead of relying on scattered emails, phone calls, or paper forms, you can funnel all resident feedback into one platform. The software automatically routes requests to the right staff member or department, sends real-time notifications, and allows you to track progress at a glance. This helps you reduce response times, improve communication, and ensure no request falls through the cracks.

### Is Issuetrak compliant with senior living regulations?
While Issuetrak itself is not a compliance certification body, it provides the essential tools to help your community maintain regulatory compliance with FHA, ADA, HIPAA, staffing ratios, CPR certifications, medication management, safety regulations, and more. Our platform creates a complete and secure audit trail for all resident requests and issues, which is critical for state and local inspections. With Issuetrak, you can easily pull detailed reports on complaints, their resolution times, and the full history of every action taken, helping you demonstrate a proactive approach to resident care and safety during audits.

### How can residents and family members use Issuetrak to easily submit complaints and requests?
Issuetrak's public-facing Webforms are the perfect solution. You can embed a simple form on your website or share a direct link or QR code with residents or family members. When someone submits a maintenance request, it instantly creates a new work order in Issuetrak. The system automatically notifies the appropriate team members and tracks the issue's full lifecycle, so you always know its status—from "new" to "in progress" to "closed."
