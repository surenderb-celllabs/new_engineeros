* "I've been using this app for 10 years. You create a recurring budget and manually log expenses, income, and transfers between budgets. It's very flexible and has kept me feeling great about my spending habits ever since I had to start earning my own money." - Lanky
* "It's got a calendar that not only reports future transactions, but it SHOWS ME HOW MUCH MONEY I'LL HAVE ON ANY GIVEN DAY!!! You can set up recurring payments, recurring account transfers, and it gives a chart of where your money is going. And it. Is. FREE." - Jason Victoria Oconaill
* "Been using this app for years, the main issue is syncing issues between multiple devices." - Anthony Balaich
