PUN Classic (v1.x) and Bolt are outdated and will not receive further updates. Of course, existing PUN Classic and Bolt projects will continue to run. New projects should use Fusion or Quantum.

### Turn-Based Game Demo
Photon Unity Networking (PUN) can be used for turn-based games, such as strategy titles or board games. This document gives an overview how to implement such games, based on our Rock Paper Scissors Demo, which is in the PUN Package.

#### PunTurnManager
The PunTurnManager is a generic Component Class that can be reused for similar games and logics. It's important to realize that it's not mandatory, but a simple and nice wrapper for you to get up and running with turn-based games quickly.

#### IPunTurnManagerCallbacks
With the IPunTurnManagerCallbacks Interface, you can listen to the main turn-based message callbacks. Refer to RpsCore Script to see how PunTurnManager can be binded.

#### TurnManager Extensions
You'll find across various known classes in PUN new properties and methods that are extensions specifically design for turn-based system.

#### RpsCore
The RpsCore Component Script is dedicated to this demo and implements the specific rules and data for a typical Rock-Paper-Scissor game.

#### RpsDemoConnect
The RpsDemoConnect component is very similar to a regular PUN project for connecting, joining room and lobby.

### Do's and Don'ts
Creating a turn-based game using PUN implies the correct use of PUN features as well as avoiding certain features not supported in turn-based context.

#### Do's
* Properly set RoomOptions.PlayerTtl when creating rooms.
* Properly set the RoomOptions.EmptyRoomTtl when creating rooms.
* Make use of Room Properties to keep track of data inherent of the ongoing game.
* Make use of Custom Player Properties to keep track of player's data that needs to persist between play sessions.
* Use PhotonPlayer.ID to keep track of players
* Use PhotonPlayer.GetNext() to iterate through the players to pass the turn.

#### Don'ts
* Don't use PhotonView components and derivates.
* Don't use PunRPC, because they need PhotonViews.
* Instead use PhotonNetwork.RaiseEvent
* Don't use PhotonNetwork.Instantiate()
