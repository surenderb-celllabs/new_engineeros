# How the Splitwise App Transformed Group Travel for Me
## Condé Nast Traveler

Group travel is inherently more stressful than most types of travel. With so many more opinions and travel styles, a pain point that you, on your own or with one or two friends, could manage easily might turn into a much larger issue with more travelers. Flight delays or rental car mishaps are always nerve-wracking, but for me, one of the most stressful times on a group trip is when the bill comes.

There are just so many complications. Say a restaurant can only take three credit cards, but you have 10 people. Or one traveler is paying for herself and her partner and needs to factor in two shares of the bill. Another is sober and didn’t consume any of the multiple bottles of wine ordered. On trips past, phone calculators were whipped out in attempts to settle up then and there so no one’s bank account was left feeling the brunt of the payment.

Then, on my most recent girls’ trip to Chicago, the planner among us made our group download the mobile app Splitwise. And that headache just—*poof*—disappeared.

The app created a financial log of our trip. Every expense was entered into Splitwise by the person who paid—from Ubers to Second City and dinner at Lula Cafe to grocery runs for breakfast food and the cost of our Airbnb. Then, seamlessly, with no need for algebra or long division on the back of napkins, we could split up the bill based on circumstance. The payments could be split equally among the whole group or just certain members. It could be divided piecemeal based on who ordered what, by uploading a picture of the receipt. The bill could also be split by shares, and even by percentages, all of which Splitwise could calculate on its own.

But the best part about Splitwise was that at the end of the trip, when it came time to pay my eight friends back, each of whom had picked up a $20 Uber or an $8 glass of wine or a $2.50 Lincoln Park farmers’ market mint tea for me along the way, I only had to actually pay two people. That’s because the app does some additional math, tracking the borrowing and lending among the group and consolidating your trip debt so payments are in a few large chunks, rather than a slew of $2.50 IOUs. Plus, since the app connects to Venmo, you can settle with those you owe with two or three taps. (You can also just mark in the app that it’s been settled offline, if you don’t have Venmo or would rather pay in cash.)

Downloading Splitwise meant that, when the check came, no one felt pressure. The friends who obsess over racking up points could drop their Chase Sapphire Reserve cards without worrying about getting paid back eventually. No one had to rack her brain after the fact to remember if so-and-so pitched in for the appetizer or ordered something different. Everything was simply entered into the app and paid out at the end of our journey. Both parties had a record of what was owed and why, which prevented often uncomfortable “you owe me” back-and-forths.

I don’t think any other app has fixed such a pervasive obstacle in group travel—and I won’t be taking another trip without it.
