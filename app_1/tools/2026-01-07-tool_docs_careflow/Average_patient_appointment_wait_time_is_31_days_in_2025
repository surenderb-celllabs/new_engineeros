# Average Patient Appointment Wait Time is 31 Days in 2025
The average appointment wait time in 2025 is 31 days, up 19% from 26 days in 2022, data shows.

## Introduction to the Problem
Appointment wait times are up 19% since 2022, with new data from AMN Healthcare showing it takes an average of 31 days for a patient to get an appointment on the books.

## Key Findings
* The assessment, which looked at 15 major metropolitan areas in the country, showed an increase in appointment wait times from 26 days in 2022.
* In 2004, appointment waits were 21 days, AMN Healthcare said.
* "Average physician appointment wait times are the longest they have been since we began conducting the survey in 2004," Leah Grant, president of AMN Healthcare's Physician Solutions division, said in a press release.
* Longer physician appointment wait times are a significant indicator that the nation is experiencing a growing shortage of physicians.

## Wait Times by City
* Boston had the longest documented appointment wait time, with patients having to wait an average of 65 days to see a physician.
* In Atlanta, which had the shortest average appointment wait time, that number was 12 days.

## Medical Specialty Matters
* The AMN Healthcare report showed vastly different wait times based on medical specialty.
* The average appointment wait times across all metros for each specialty are as follows:
  * Obstetrics/Gynecology: 42 days, up 33% since 2022.
  * Gastroenterology: 40 days (gastroenterology was added to the survey in 2025).
  * Dermatology: 36.5 days, up 6% since 2022.
  * Cardiology: 33 days, up 23% from 2022.
  * Family medicine: 23.5 days, up 14% since 2022.
  * Orthopedic surgery: 12 days, down 29% since 2022.

## Insurance and Access to Care
* Most patients prioritize booking appointments with healthcare providers who accept their insurance, which can be difficult especially for folks with public insurance such as Medicare and Medicaid.
* Across all of the metros studied, 82% of physicians accept Medicare.
* It's less common for physicians to accept Medicaid, the assessment showed. Just over half (53%) of physicians across all 15 metropolitan areas studied accepted Medicaid.

## Conclusion
* "The type of health insurance patients have may impact their access to physicians," Grant concluded. "While Medicare is widely accepted by physicians, Medicaid is less so."
