I’m building a competitive online chess platform with one goal: Make it possible for strong players to earn real, consistent money from playing chess.
* You connect your wallet (or use Google/Apple login — no KYC, no friction)
* Choose a game mode: Blitz, Bullet, Classic, or join a tournament (Arena / KO format)
* Select a buy-in (from $0.10 to $1000 — in crypto)
* Win games, take the pot (minus platform rake)
* Play against real players or AI bots (adjusted to your Elo if no player is found in 60s)
* Elo works like Chess.com — no gimmicks
### Example
* Play an 8-player Blitz tournament with a $5 buy-in
* Prize pool = $40 → winner takes $24, finalist gets $12
* That’s 4–5x your stake in 20 minutes
### Alternative
* Play for 30 minutes
* Top 3 scorers split the prize pot
* The better you perform, the more you earn
### Career Mode + Referrals
* Track your season stats, climb the rankings, and unlock bonuses
* Invite friends, get $5 USDT per new player who completes a match
### Why I’m posting
Could a system like this actually support high-volume players — students, grinders, part-time streamers — the way online poker used to? Would you personally play 3–5 games a day if the skill/reward balance made it worthwhile?
Would love honest feedback — even brutal is welcome. Thanks
