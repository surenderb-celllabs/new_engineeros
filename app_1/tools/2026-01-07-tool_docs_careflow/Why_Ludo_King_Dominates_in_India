# Why Ludo King Dominates in India
By Oindrila Mandal • November 6, 2024

## Introduction
Ludo King surpassing a billion downloads worldwide was no accident. Gametion’s family-friendly board game adaptation has risen to new heights of popularity through a set of carefully crafted product strategies that have captured the hearts of Indian mobile gamers.

## Ludo King's Popularity
Ludo King is the most downloaded game in India through the first three quarters of 2024 and is fourth in terms of active users. It has also done well in Indonesia, which delivers 6% of downloads and 10% of revenue. India is the primary market, though, with nearly 80% of downloads and over 40% of net revenue.

## How Ludo King is Winning in India
### Popularity of Ludo
Ludo is an extremely popular board game in the Indian subcontinent, and has been enjoyed by children and adults alike for centuries. Such strong brand recognition is a huge advantage in today’s UA environment, as is evident in the sheer number of organic downloads for Ludo King.

### Simple, Quick Gameplay
Gametion has managed to further simplify the core gameplay of Ludo with one-click die cast and quicker gameplay. In Quick Ludo mode, a match takes only five minutes, while a traditional Ludo board game could last anywhere between 30-90 minutes.

### Social Connection
In board game form, Ludo is inherently a social multiplayer game for 2-4 players. But Ludo King has multiplayer modes that support up to six players, and like most social mobile games, players can also connect with their friends through social media.

## Monetization Strategies
### Ad Monetization
Despite Ludo King’s impressive user base, its reported IAP revenue lags behind competitors. This is due to its focus on ad revenue. It is heavily ad-monetized with multiple opportunities for players to watch rewarded video ads.

### Regionalized IAP Monetization System
Ludo King sells its smallest IAP pack in India for 9 INR ($0.11). In Indonesia, the same pack is priced at 3 IDR ($0.19). In contrast, its smallest IAP pack in the U.S. is priced at $1.19.

## Localization and Culturalization
Ludo King owes its success in India to deep culturalization. What many publishers get wrong about India is that the country is not a monolithic market. With over 1.4B people, India is a melting pot of diverse cultures and regional identities.

## Concluding Thoughts
Can Ludo King’s success in India be replicated by global publishers? The answer is yes. We have already seen mobile games like Battlegrounds Mobile India, Garena Free Fire, and Candy Crush achieve similar success in this market.
