I dont get it...I log in daily to chess.com but somehow I do not see that I am running out of time on games. I have lost 5 games just recently because of your application failure. I will never engage in a tournament here on chess.com again.

I have seen one other topic recently on alerts. Probably a temporary bug.

Well that temporary bug cost me my rating I have worked very hard and long to earn. I am a programmer and have offered my services to your organization. Lets make it run correctly. Cheers, Amber

Whatever rating points you lost, you will get back.

Really, alerts are a nice feature but probably shouldn't be relied on too much. If you have a number of games, where it's your move , it is probably best to verify how much time is on each one, when on. I have lost a few no-vaction tourney games when I neglected to double check and thought I had more time than I actually had. I'm not saying the alert feature shouldn't be more robust.

I did check, but somehow there is a limit to the number of games shown by default in the Home list, and no easy way to view all.
1. the list should be prioritized by time
2. there should be a method to page thru the entire list from the Home page

Is it true that I will receive back my lost rating points?

GodsPawn2016 was referring to the fact that as you play more games your rating will get back to where it would have been, without those time losses. You could open a ticket about it but I can't say if they will decide the glitch warrants it or not. https://support.chess.com/customer/portal/emails/new That said, does going to the Daily page and then clicking on Current Game not show all games?  Or allow you to see all games? It's been a while since I had that many active games to check.

I dont know what you mean by clicking on Current Game, to get a list of all games, but when you go "Home" you see only a list of six games(in Online Chess category), in no apparent order (maybe alphabetic?). From here there is no way to page forward if your list exceeds six games.

correction Online Chess instead of Online Games

Yeah, Home is limited but you can click the header to get a fuller list.

## ManUser

If you assume the list is ordered for "time to make your move" why would you need to see the whole list?

## Martin_Stahl

I really don't know for sure how it is ordered. I would assume it should be time left but that may not be the case.

## ManUser

No there is still something strange going on...Im not seeing games I need to respond to in my list at all... had another timeout just happen yesterday?

You can open a ticket about it but I would suggest using the fuller game list and not the Home game list.
