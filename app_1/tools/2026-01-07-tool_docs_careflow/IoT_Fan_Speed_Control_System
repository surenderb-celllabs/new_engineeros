## Importance of Temperature Control in Modern Systems
In today’s energy-conscious world, managing temperature effectively is crucial. Temperature control systems, such as fans and HVAC units, are integral to maintaining optimal conditions in various environments, including homes, offices, and industrial settings. However, traditional systems often operate at fixed speeds, leading to energy inefficiency. Implementing dynamic temperature-based control can significantly reduce energy consumption and enhance comfort.

## Role of IoT in Automation
The Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized automation by enabling devices to communicate and make intelligent decisions. Incorporating IoT into temperature control systems allows for real-time monitoring, remote access, and adaptive responses to environmental changes, leading to smarter and more efficient operations.

## Why Temperature-Based Fan Speed Control Matters
Energy Consumption in Cooling Systems: Cooling systems, especially fans, often operate at full capacity regardless of the actual temperature, leading to unnecessary energy consumption. By adjusting fan speeds based on real-time temperature data, energy usage can be optimized, contributing to lower electricity bills and reduced environmental impact.
