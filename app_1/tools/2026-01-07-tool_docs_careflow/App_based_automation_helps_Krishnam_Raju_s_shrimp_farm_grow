# App-based automation helps Krishnam Raju’s shrimp farm grow
## Introduction to Accion
Accion is a global nonprofit on a mission to create a fair and inclusive economy. We work with local partners to develop and scale responsible digital financial solutions for underserved people globally, so they can make informed decisions and improve their lives.

## The Challenge of Farming
Farming is an essential but challenging line of work. Around the world, farmers operate on razor-thin margins. Payment only comes at the harvest, which can be as infrequent as once per year, leaving them financially vulnerable for months at a time. Crop failure can be devastating. In the face of changing consumption patterns, escalating climate risks, and economic uncertainty, farmers need reliable ways to ensure their own livelihoods while feeding the world’s growing population and creating a positive environmental impact.

## AquaExchange: A Solution for Aquaculture Farmers
AquaExchange is a full stack solution that provides farm management technology (IoT solutions) and financial services to aquaculture farmers and exporters in rural India. Their vision is to improve farmer productivity and livelihoods in the second-largest aquaculture country in the world. AquaExchange, an Accion Venture Lab portfolio company, has reached thousands of farmers since its founding in 2020, helping their operations become more efficient and sustainable.

## How AquaExchange Works
AquaExchange’s solar-powered moving feeder automates crop feeding. Farmers like Krishnam Raju can purchase seed, feed, and other products at low prices and get the inputs delivered right to their farms using AquaExchange’s app. The app also allows farmers to monitor the aerators and automate feeding their prawns. If the pond loses power, farmers receive an alert on their phone through the app and an employee can resolve the situation — preventing total loss of the entire crop.

## Benefits for Farmers
AquaExchange supports aquaculture farmers at every step of the crop cycle, from seed to sale. The platform provides end-to-end procurement management, directly connecting farmers to exporters so they can sell their crops at a fair price. These features reduce costs and minimize waste of money, feed, and energy so that aquaculture farmers can improve their harvests and increase their incomes.

## Accion's Investment in AquaExchange
Accion invests in and provides strategic guidance to innovative, scalable fintech companies like AquaExchange that improve the reach, quality, and affordability of financial services for the underserved. AquaExchange’s focus on farmers, and their insight into what smallholder farmers really need to thrive, will make them invaluable to the growing aquaculture market.
