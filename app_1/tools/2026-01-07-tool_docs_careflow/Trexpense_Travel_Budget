## Reviews
* **Amy Gangl**: As a free user you can only see expenses by day & in list form. You don't have access to any charts so not sure how they look. I like the look of the list view & how the day view summarizes by category, but it would be nice to see a list of all trips.
* **V Jaicheun**: Nicely designed app, easy to use, visually appealing, and option to export to PDF or CSV is a great bonus. Would be 5 stars if (1) instead of automatically splitting the expense equally among travelers, an option to change the split ratio was added. (2) Daily total shows both home and local currencies. (3) Ability to deactivate a traveler.
* **Simon Str**: This is a MUST-HAVE app for all of your trips - doesn't matter if it's just a weekend trip or a worldtrip for some month! Very easy and intuitive to use. Basic functions are free and with a subscription you get some very handy features: e.g. customisable categories, split expenses or cloud sync your trips and use it with your friends.
