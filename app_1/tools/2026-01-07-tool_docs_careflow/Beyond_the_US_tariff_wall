## Introduction
Subba Naidu, a shrimp farmer from Prakasam district in Andhra Pradesh, has witnessed a fluctuation in the market initially but is now relieved. His fears of losing heavily due to the US tariffs on shrimp imports from India have withered away.

## Shrimp Farmers' Response
* Vannamei farmers witnessed fluctuation initially, but the situation is back to normal now.
* Some farmers moved to tiger prawns, which has a good demand internationally.
* The price for tiger prawns has been more stable and was not negatively affected by the new tariffs.
* The current price is good for farmers, around ₹590 to ₹600 per kilogramme for a 20-count size.

## Impact of Sanctions
* The sanctions have not affected the farmers much because US buyers absorbed the tariff burden.
* India did not rely solely on the US and instead opened new markets such as the UK, Russia, South Korea, and European markets.
* Australia lifted its ban on prawn imports from India.

## Price Increase
* There was an increase in price post-tariffs by up to ₹10-20/kg.

## Indian Shrimp Industry
* The strength of the Indian shrimp industry is its ability to supply peeled shrimp at scale, the particular form that the US wanted.
* They require Indian shrimp, and India also needs that market.
* They absorbed the pricing, offering lower prices but absorbing the impact.

## Alternative Markets
* The EU and China are predominantly the areas for diversification.
* Partly Vietnam, where prawn farming is not doing well.
* Australia has not started importing Indian prawns yet.

## Drop in US Market
* There is at least a 15% drop in the US market.
* This drop was covered in alternative markets.

## Seafood Exports
* Seafood exports showed a healthy increase of 11.6% in value terms.
* Exports moved from $4.2 billion between April and October 2024 to $4.7 billion in the same period this year.
* This uptrend was fashioned by strong growth in exports to EU, China, Vietnam, Russia, and UK.

## Conclusion
The Indian shrimp industry has been able to shrug off worries and expand its global footprint despite the US tariffs. The industry's ability to supply peeled shrimp at scale and the opening of new markets have helped to absorb the impact of the sanctions.
