# Top 5 Challenges of Travel and Expense Management
## Author: Dennis Najjar

International expansions, business mobility, and globalization contribute to increased travel expenses for many companies. These challenges frequently fall under five primary categories, and you need to overcome them to regain control over the company's expense accounts.

### 1. Unclear Travel Expense Policies
Travel expense policies may be confusing or difficult to understand. If employees don't know exactly what falls under an acceptable payment, then they have no way to avoid running into issues.
* Common travel costs, such as hotel and food, should be clearly written out.
* If your organization has a partnership with specific chains or a preferred list of businesses, provide a convenient reference sheet to save time and reduce complexity.
* A mobile app containing this information would work out the best for your business travelers.

### 2. Poor Expense Visibility
Do you know the top spending categories in the travel expense accounts? How about the average amount an employee pays for food every day during a business trip? If you lack visibility into this data, you face major hurdles during an auditing and optimization process.
* Your current system may be insufficient to display the data in useful forms.
* Structure your reporting so you can quickly pull up a wide variety of reports.

### 3. Inefficient Processes
Are you entering expense information into a spreadsheet? Manual processes make it difficult to stay on top of the incoming costs, particularly if you have hundreds of employees sending their information.
* You need an overhaul of your travel expense management processes to overcome this roadblock.
* Throw out the spreadsheets and get an automated system in place to eliminate your data entry.
* Some favorite applications include Expensify, Tallie, Concur, and Nexonia.

### 4. Delayed Employee Reimbursement
How long does it take to approve or deny employee reimbursement? If you handle travel expenses after the fact, you don't want to leave staff waiting to get their money back.
* Many factors lead to delayed employee reimbursement, from waiting too long to process an expense report to missing key information.
* Audit your current process and look for the problems that contribute to the speed issues.
* By employing a bill management system such as Bill.com, you can expedite the reimbursement process via ACH directly into your employees' accounts.

### 5. Overlooking Employee Travel Expense Trends
A spreadsheet or similar system reduces your data visibility to a single point in time. You have no way to tell if an employee's expenses are atypical to their normal pattern because you can't see the other puzzle pieces in the picture.
* You need to compare historical trends to the company and individual employee average.
* A robust accounting system gives you the necessary information and shows you where to begin your investigation.

Effective travel expense management is a tricky process, especially if you have outdated or inefficient systems lying underneath. By identifying your problem areas and putting the right solution in place for each, you can improve the way your organization addresses travel expenses.
