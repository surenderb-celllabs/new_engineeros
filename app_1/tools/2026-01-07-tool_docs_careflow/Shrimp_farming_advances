# Shrimp Farming Advances, Challenges, and Opportunities
## Introduction
The shrimp industry has experienced significant growth over the last decade, with total imports in 2022 reaching 3,248,338 tons. China and Vietnam in Asia, and the US have absorbed most of the growth in shrimp production. Ecuador has seen a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17% from 2012 to 2019 and a very significant CAGR of 25% from 2020 to Q2 2023.

## Current State of Shrimp Farming
* Total imports in 2022: 3,248,338 tons
* China and Vietnam in Asia, and the US have absorbed most of the growth in shrimp production
* Ecuador has seen a CAGR of 17% from 2012 to 2019 and a CAGR of 25% from 2020 to Q2 2023
* Reported production by the National Aquaculture Chamber (CNA) in Ecuador was 1,051,758 tons in 2022, with an expected 10% increase for 2023

## Challenges Facing Shrimp Farming
* Feed cost: Ingredients used for shrimp feed formulations have had marked increases in the past decade
* Market prices: Shrimp prices have dropped due to oversupply and slow market demand
* Disease: Shrimp has been affected the most by diseases, with losses of around 22%/year, equivalent to US$1 billion
* Broodstock quality: Selective breeding for rapid growth based on SPF lines for white shrimp has been successful, but the onset of diseases has changed selection strategies

## Opportunities to Reduce Production Costs and Improve Production Efficiency
* New manufacturing processes, like extrusion, have shown clear benefits in FCR improvement and a reduction of residual organic matter in the ponds
* Automatic feeding and aeration have shown benefits for better feed usage, but equipment and installation costs deter some producers from incorporating them
* Understanding carrying capacity in changing culture conditions is essential to avoid past mistakes when deciding to increase stocking densities to improve yields
* New protein sources like insect meal, unicellular proteins, and vegetables will play a relevant role in reducing feed costs

## Future of Shrimp Farming
* The current geopolitical situation is affecting the market, leading to consolidation and better vertical integration to reduce production costs
* Streamlined and continuous offer of high-quality, traceable shrimp from certified farms would reduce seasonal price variations and eventually lead to production contracts of insured crops
* Hyper-intensive RAS production needs to complete its validation process, but when it does, will eventually contribute to a reduced carbon footprint by establishing production areas near niche markets
