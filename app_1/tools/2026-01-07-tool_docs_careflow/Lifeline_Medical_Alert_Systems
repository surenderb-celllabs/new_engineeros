> I am completely happy with it!
After my husband was deceased and I was living alone, the kids saw that Lifeline was necessary. I’m completely happy with it. They responded as quickly as I would expect under the circumstances that I had used it. Both times, I was outside and I fell on the ice and the response was good. They called my responders and one of them was just a little over a block away, and she was here in just no time flat.

## Caution
Caution: To reduce any risk of strangulation, Lifeline neck cords are designed to break apart under certain conditions. However, any cord worn around the neck can pose a strangulation risk, including the possibility of death and serious injuries. This may be of more concern to wearers in wheelchairs, using walkers, using beds with guardrails, or who might encounter other protruding objects upon which the cord can become tangled.
