#### Are solo-only games becoming less popular?
I took a look at the stats for solo-only games this year (using the BGG family "Players: Solitaire Only Games") and found only 7 games for 2025, all with a pretty low number of ratings:

| Game | Total number of ratings |
| --- | --- |
| R.A.V.E.L. | 108 |
| Glass Garden | 120 |
| Hyperstar Run | 153 |
| Golden Age of Piracy: 1718 | 53 |
| Wraith & The Giants | 71 |
| Judgemint of the Realm Lords | 39 |
| Witchbound | 39 |

In comparison, 2024 had 39 solo-only games, which is on track with every year since COVID. And a lot of them have much larger numbers of ratings, like Kingdom Legacy (1,790 ratings), Gloomhaven: Buttons and Bugs (2,915 ratings), and Conservas (1,343).

On the other hand, if you just search for all games with solitaire rules, 2025 has 73 and 2024 had 84, so this disparity seems to be specific to solo-only games and not soloable games in general. One illustrative example is Unstoppable; although it's in Renegade's Solo Hero series which was originally just solo-only games, the designers added in a 2-player coop mode and it has 10x the ratings of Wraith & The Giants (also in the Solo Hero series).

I know we're not all the way through 2025 yet, but we're basically in Q4, so I'm curious if people think it's true that solo-only games are losing popularity and why.

### Edit
One other guess for what might be happening is that, now that solo games are becoming more popular, we're seeing the opposite of the phenomenon of multiplayer games where solo was tacked on as an afterthought. More solo games are being made now, but instead of leaving them as solo-only, a coop mode is added on at the end for marketability. It would explain why a game like Unstoppable is in the "Solo Hero" series but has coop.
