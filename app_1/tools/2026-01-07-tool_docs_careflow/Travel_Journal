## Reviews
* **01/06/2021 - Tuxpena**: I have had this app for a long time, wrote my travel journals and now the Travel Journal app is blank, I lost all the information kept on it.
* **01/06/2021 - Tuxpena**: I have had this app for a long time, wrote my travel journals and now the Travel Journal app is blank, I lost all the information kept on it. Use a spreadsheet not this app.
* **07/04/2015 - Shkydx Mitzi**: Not much to this app. Most annoying is the fact that it just keeps popping up a request to allow your location to be used even if you do not want that feature enabled. I wound up deleting the app this was so irritating. It also tags posts with the time which if you are doing this post trip is annoying and can not be deleted or adjusted. Add to that the idea that each date is apparently a separate journal rather than a collection of dates for a trip. So not much flexibility of organization or much logic that a trip includes multiple days. So I can do more with a spreadsheet than this does as a travel journal. Tried it because I want it on my mac not on my phone and this was about the only choice in the app store. So this app is totally useless. Use a spreadsheet not this app.
* **02/23/2016 - DisappointeduserinSac**: I am not a fast typer, but this app cannot keep up. Just two paragraphs, that’s all it took to slow this app down to a crawl. My macbook is of a decent spec too! A macbook pro, 2.7GHz i7 CPU and 16 GB memory. I can run everything just fine, including heavy duty apps like Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom. As I type, it cursor disappears and characters start to appear, about one a second, just amazing and it makes it totally unusable. I like the look of the app, there is an elegance to it that I quite like and it has some nice features. For example, (assuming you have allowed the app to use your location), just click a pin and it inserts a map with the location you are at, into the journal entry. Very cool. Too bad about the extreme typing issue. I have trashed the app as I cannot use this.
	+ **Developer Response**: Thanks for your review, mentioning the problems. We have fixed all the issues, and updated the app. Please apply the current update. It will work properly now.
* **03/30/2015 - potestas8415**: I bought this app because it seemed very interesting: a perfect way to save thought, pics and memories of your travels! But it’s so slow (it lasts minutes before you can actually use the app) and when it’s open my Mac doesn’t work properly (it seems like a PC: slow, clumsy…).
	+ **Developer Response**: Hi, Thanks for your review. We have fixed the issues of freeze, and crashes, and also other inconsistencies. Please apply the current update. It will work properly now.
* **03/31/2015 - all in the**: I like the simplicity of this. Please add Weather to location, something automatic. Otherwise it does what it says it does.
