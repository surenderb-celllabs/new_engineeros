# 11 Best Assisted Living Software Platforms
Assisted living software provides a range of functions to simplify facility operations and give administrators more time to focus on growing their business. It coordinates and manages resident care, streamlines facility operations, automates back-office processes, schedules staff, stores records, and generates reports.

## Why Do Administrators Need Assisted Living Software?
Assisted living software covers various processes and operations, from resident intake to employee scheduling, giving administrators more time to focus on growing their business. Assisted living facility software allows administrators to supervise business operations, maintain staff records, keep track of resident medical records, manage medications, and ensure regulatory compliance.

### Benefits of Assisted Living Software
1. **Automated compliance**: Assisted living software ensures organizations and staff comply with health and safety regulations.
