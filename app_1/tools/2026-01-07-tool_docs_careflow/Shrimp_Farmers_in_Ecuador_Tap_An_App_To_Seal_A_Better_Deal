# Shrimp Farmers in Ecuador Tap An App To Seal A Better Deal
XpertSea’s newest machine-learning product digitizes marketplace to help producers compete – and be compensated – fairly

When Quebec, Canada-based XpertSea introduced its new, artificial intelligence-powered smartphone mobile app at Ecuador’s Aqua Expo last month, the company’s booth was inundated with dignitaries, journalists and farmers. The minister of foreign affairs attended with the vice-minister of environment and the president of Ecuador’s National Chamber of Aquaculture. Twenty journalists sought interviews and farmers clamored for information about the app and for the free white trays XpertSea was distributing to anyone who wanted them.

## How the App Works
The app allows farmers to capture accurate shrimp health and quality data by taking a photograph of a sample of shrimp from their ponds using the white tray and their smartphone. XpertSea’s platform, which contains growth data accumulated over many years, accurately predicts the commercial size of the shrimp and the pond value. When farmers are ready to sell their harvest they do so through the app, which puts their harvest out to bid to different shrimp processors across the country. XpertSea manages and guarantees the transaction between farmer and processor, ensuring that farmers are paid 80 percent of their crop value within 24 hours of harvest, and the remainder within a few days.

## Farmer Response
Guillaume Breton-Ménard, general manager of XpertSea in Ecuador, said farmers at the trade show were excited about the technology and keen to try it.
“Farmers are really motivated to digitalize their operations and there’s no other technology out there like this,” he said. “We’re able to prove the accuracy of the technology and because we’re a Canadian company that has been working on this solution for a long time, they trust our data. We’ve collected hundreds of thousands of data points just from Ecuador, so the technology the farmers are using is specific to their country.”

To date the app is only available in Ecuador but in the past two months alone it has been downloaded by 250 farmers. According to XpertSea, in the first few months that the app was operational, more than 7 million pounds of shrimp were traded on it.

## Benefits for Farmers
Harry Viafara owns Exporcareca, a 160-hectare shrimp farm in Taura, which is located in the province of Guayas, and began using XpertSea’s app three months ago.
“Prior to using this app, I could only sell my shrimp to three or four processing plants in Guayas with whom I had an existing relationship,” he said. “I would get 50 percent of payment three days after harvest and in worst-case scenarios, I had to wait 30 days after harvest for payment. In some cases the processing plants would cancel our agreement or change the terms of the agreement after they received my shrimp.”

The app has opened up new markets for his shrimp trading beyond the provincial boundaries of Guayas, creating new relationships where his payment is guaranteed by XpertSea, meaning he carries no risk of the transaction failing.
“When I use the app I harvest in the morning and get paid in the afternoon – and the payment price is better than before,” he said. “I’m selling as far away as Santo Domingo now. With these better prices and many more selling options, I can increase production because I know there’s more demand for my shrimp.”

## Future Plans
Valerie Robitaille, CEO at XpertSea, said it’s exciting to see farmers get a real return on their product and grow better shrimp: “Before we launched this app, the shrimp were trading more as a commodity. Now we have buyers who have a specific order for quality shrimp connecting with farmers who are getting better prices. We’re really hopeful this will give farmers monetary incentive to keep producing a better product.”

XpertSea plans to release the app in a yet-to-be-determined country in Southeast Asia in the future. “There’s so much complexity in the value chain and the transaction, and every marketplace is unique,” Robitaille said. “As we do proof-of-concept in other places we’re seeing great potential because other markets are even more segmented than Ecuador. But we’ll most likely move forward market by market, using Ecuador as our test case.”
