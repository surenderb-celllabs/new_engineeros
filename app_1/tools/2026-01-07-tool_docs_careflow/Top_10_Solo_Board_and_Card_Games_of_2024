# Top 10 Solo Board and Card Games of 2024
What makes a good solo game?  I find them when I typically start playing solo games to learn that game cooperatively for my friends. If a game starts to enchant me and I can’t stop playing it solo … there’s something to it! All the games on this list were games I played solo to teach my friends … but then I kept playing! Some of these games will end up on either my Top 10 Cooperative Games of 2024, some but of them will end up on my Top Cooperative Expansions of 2024, but one things for sure … they are all great solo!

## Honorable Mention: Solo Project PEGASUS Campaign for Marvel United
After getting Marvel United Multiverse Season 3 with all of its content, I was very taken with the Campaign Decks (see below and see review here), but I was saddened to learn there was no campaign for the Project PEGASUS saga (see above)!
So I spent many many weeks developing my own campaign using all of the Marvel United content! This is a print-and-play campaign for Marvel United! I played this campaign solo over and over and over again (multi-handed with 2, 3, and 4 characters) as I playtested all the the different combinations of characters! There is no game I played more solo this year than the Marvel United: Project PEGASUS campaign!
It’s awkward to put this on our list since I developed it, but I had so much fun playtesting it solo over and over for weeks and weeks, I had to acknowledge how much time and how much fun I had with this! If you liked the Marvel United Campaign Decks and wanted more, check out the free  Project PEGASUS Campaign here!

## Top 10 Solo Board and Card Games of 2024
1. **Skytear Horde: Monoliths**: Now, Skytear Horde: Monoliths is a standalone expansion in the Skytear Horde universe! This is a great little solo and cooperative tower defense game!
2. **Batman: Gotham City Chronicles + Solo/Cooperative Expansion**: So, you can’t play Batman: Gotham City Chronicles solo without both the base game (which came out years ago) and the Solo/Cooperative Expansion (which came out this year)!
3. **NYC: Emergency Room**: This might strike you as an odd pick: A Medical Mystery game! I picked this up at Target and really enjoyed playing through the mysteries of the game!
4. **Everdell: Duo**: I wasn’t expecting to like Everdell: Duo as much as a I did! My first playthroughs were a bit “clunky”, as the game has some fiddly bits and documentation issues you have to get through.
5. **Rise of the Unfolders: Tidal Blades 2**: I didn’t know a lot about the original Tidal Blades when I backed this, but Tidal Blades 2 looked like a fun little cooperative dungeon crawler.
6. **Robinson Crusoe: Collector’s Edition (primer)**: This is an odd duck of an entry; the Collector’s Edition of Robinson Crusoe arrived this years (3 years late, which made a lot of people angry) and had some amazing minis and components … for a worker placement game that probably doesn’t need them!
7. **Marvel United: Campaign Deck. Dark Phoenix Saga**: The Campaign Decks (see above) came with Season 3 of Marvel United: Multiverse.
8. **Aeon’s End: The Descent**: This one was a late comer and almost didn’t make our list! It came in late late November, just before Thanksgiving!
9. **Sammu-Ramat**: Any other year, this probably would have been my #1 game of the year! I went back and forth a number of times, so this could easily be my #1!
10. **Set A Watch: Doomed Run**: This game has no right to be the #1 spot; this is a giant campaign game in the Set A Watch Universe.
