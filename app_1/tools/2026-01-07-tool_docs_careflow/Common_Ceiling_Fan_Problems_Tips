## 8 Ceiling Fan Problems
While there are some issues which can be easily fixed, others may require professional help. So, if you ceiling fan is not working, let’s get started and learn how to keep your ceiling fan running smoothly and efficiently all year round.

1. **Reduced Speed**: Your ceiling fan speed problem could be a result of dirty or damaged ball bearings. 
    * Solution: To solve your ceiling fan speed problem, all you have to do is lubricate the ball bearings. If there is too much dust accumulation on the bearings, use rubbing alcohol to effectively clean the ball bearings.
2. **Noisy Operation**: The noisy operation of a ceiling fan is quite a common complaint among users. 
    * Solution: You can get rid of your ceiling fan sound problem by tightening the screws. If the problem is due to the ball bearings, lubricate them to solve the problem.
3. **Wobbly Fan**: Wobbly ceiling fans appear to be on the verge of falling from the ceiling. 
    * Solution: You can start by ensuring that all the parts of the fan are tightened well. You must also measure the ceiling fan blade tips to check if they are at an even distance. If they are not, one or more fan blades may be bent or warped.
4. **Flickering Lights**: Flickering ceiling fan lights can be caused by three things: a fused bulb, a loose connection with either the bulb or the fixture, and a more serious cause, voltage fluctuation.
    * Solution: If the problem is the fused bulb, you can simply replace it with a new one. But if the flickering is caused by a loss of connection or voltage fluctuation, you must consult your electrician to help fix the issue.
5. **Stuck on One Speed**: You might face this problem because of certain issues like dust-accumulated ball bearings, faulty fans, motor overheating, or a failing capacitor.
    * Solution: If the problem lies in the ball bearings, just lubricate them. A faulty fan might need to be replaced with a new one.
6. **Capacitor Burn-out**: If you have a problem with the ceiling fan capacitor not working properly, you will face a ceiling fan speed problem. 
    * Solution: You will have to replace the damaged capacitor with a new one.
7. **Low Voltage**: Your ceiling fan’s low voltage problem could be a direct result of your home’s voltage decreasing. 
    * Solution: There are two ways to troubleshoot this problem: you can either report a low voltage supply problem to your power supplier or increase your ceiling fan speed by increasing the capacitor value.
8. **The Fan Doesn’t Switch on at All**: This could either happen because your circuit breaker has tripped or because of loose connections and internal defects.
    * Solution: You might have to replace the defective components. However, if the problem is with your circuit breaker, you must consult an electrician.
