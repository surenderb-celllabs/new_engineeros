# Re: Most horrible travel expense application ever!
## Original Post
Hello Concur community, Concur employees, and users! My name is Chris, and I am a very, very frustrated Concur expense report user. This Concur expense software is probably the worst app I've even worked with, in the past 5-10 years, if not forever. How do you, Concur tool developers, figure out that a person takes 3+ hours to fill out an expense report, worth approximately $1,000? Your tool is NOT user-friendly, it is NOT intuitive, and the silliness of details is astronomical. I could probably write a five-page white paper on how many silly steps and un-intuitive steps one must take to complete an expense report. Shame on you guys, at Concur, shame on you for maintaining such a dinosauric app in this modern world. Anyone else feel the same way? How my employer still does business with you will be one of the biggest mysteries of my career...

* **Orit_Dor**: I am a client with Concur and run the application in my organization. I just wanted to point out that the client can set and decide how many required fields the user will need to fill in, it’s in their hand to make it easier to the end user.
* **russellsnow**: It takes me weeks to get up enough energy to force myself to face it. I'm 100% travel so it's a big deal. The system seems to be designed for a manager that takes a few days for a conference once a year. If anything happens out of the narrow confines it gets really painful.
* **KevinD**: @russellsnow hello there. What would be an example of something "out of the narrow confines"? I'm asking because these confines are usually due to rules put in place by your company.
* **russellsnow**: My main problem is that it isn't a spreadsheet. You have tabular data. It is presented as tabular data. It eventually probably gets reported as tabular data but you interact with it as a webpage. Everything you do required 5 mouse clicks to do it. Make the interface a spreadsheet.
* **MichaelMü**: Amen. I just wasted 3 hours of my life trying to file 3 expense reports and I'm not even half way through. Nothing of this piece of software is intuitive.
* **Serskine**: I have been a Concur admin for years. It sounds like to me that there may be different reasoning for the frustration. It might be company rules that are put in place that are causing road blocks for end users.
* **russellsnow**: The problem is that everyone is mesmerized by phone apps. This should not be a phone app. Assume a moderately sized laptop and a spreadsheet.
* **JorgeL**: Are you aware that Concur has an online site where you can work from your desktop/laptop? You don't need to use the phone app to use Concur.
* **amanda65**: I joined this forum to say how impossibly frustrating and difficult (impossible) Concur is to use, but the worst thing to me is, the phone and computer apps DO NOT SYNC.
* **xray**: You are so correct Chris. I would like to speak about the brain trust that took away the weekly view of the expense reports.
* **KevinD**: @xray while you are correct that spreadsheets are free, spreadsheets cannot go into a payment batch to make several reimbursement payments at once.
* **StaticBool**: I would agree as far as Spreadsheets are rarely a good thing to perform a corporate process, once the number of employees exceeds 1...However it is applications like Concur, even in 2024, that make user still use this as a workaround.
* **TPM2**: I found this comment thread when searching the Internet in hopes of finding a CONCUR User Guide that might actually help me with clearing some of the incessant alerts I get every time I enter travel for anyone in my department.
* **KevinD**: @TPM2 from the sounds of your post you are doing expense reports for other people, correct? I do understand your frustration.
* **TPM2**: Hi Kevin, Fine to go in and act as me, I'm OK with it if it can help. RE: Airfare - It kept throwing errors when I tried that.
* **dp1**: Just wanted to chime in and say I 100% agree with Chris!!!!!! I have been using Concur for probably 10 years and absolutely seen this piece of software go from 'ok' to an absolute convoluted mess.
* **MiserableUser**: It’s a NIGHTMARE. So we opt out to save our sanity, but that generates out of pocket expenses, admin and tax drama for faculty.
