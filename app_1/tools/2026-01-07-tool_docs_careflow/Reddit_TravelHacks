Looking for a good app to split travel expenses between 4 people.

We are a group of four going on vacation and I’m looking for an easy to use, reliable app that can split travel expenses (open to non-app related expense tracking too)! We used Tricount and for some reason the calculations were off and I couldn’t figure out why. What app has worked for you? If you’re travelling in a group and didn’t use an app, how did you track expenses?
