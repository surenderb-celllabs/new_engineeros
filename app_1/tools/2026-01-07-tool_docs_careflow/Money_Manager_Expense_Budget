## Reviews
### Nancy V
I've been using this app for years. I would love it even more if they had a budget tracker built in. for example, I have a groceries category and am able to see how much I spend each month on groceries. but I would love if there could be a tracker that shows if im approaching my grocery limit for the month. I would also like to be able to split transactions. for example if I had a transaction for $20 but spent $15 on clothing and $5 on groceries, I would like to split that accordingly.

I ADORE this app, it makes keeping track of my income and expenses so much more manageable and has helped me save a ton now that I know where my money is going, all WITHOUT requiring my bank account information. I love how customizable it is, and the statistics are a very nice plus! The ads are not intrusive of the app in any way, shape, or form, but regardless the lifetime subscription is only $5.49. The developers have done such a phenomenal job on this app, I recommend it to everyone!

Two months in and this app has been great! The only complaint is that there's no way to see a current available balance if you've put in information for future payments/bills which is inconvenient for people that have auto pay bills and are salaried so paychecks remain the same. If that feature is ever added itd be an easy 5 stars.
