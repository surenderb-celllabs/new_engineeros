# India Dismisses Allegations of Abusive Conditions at Shrimp Farms
India has strongly refuted allegations of human rights and environmental abuses raised by a Chicago-based human rights group. The allegations were made against the country's shrimp farming and processing sector.

## Background
India has emerged as one of the world's largest shrimp exporters, with a significant share in the US market. In 2022-23, India's seafood exports stood at $8.09 billion, with shrimps accounting for $5.6 billion.

## Allegations and Response
A report by the Corporate Accountability Lab (CAL) alleged abusive working conditions in some shrimp hatcheries, growing ponds, and peeling sheds. However, a senior official termed the report as "baseless" and asserted that the entire value chain for India's shrimp exports is certified by the Marine Products Export Development Authority (MPEDA).

## Compliance with Global Norms
The official noted that there is no scope for concerns about overseas shipments, as the sector is regularly monitored by regulatory agencies in India and audited by inspectors from the USFDA, European Commission, and the GAC of China.

## Next Steps
The Ministry of Commerce is likely to advise exporters to commission independent studies on working conditions at shrimp farms to dispel concerns in major markets like the US and EU. The Andhra Pradesh government has also been asked to look into the allegations made in the CAL report.

## Statistics
* About 1 lakh shrimp farms in Andhra Pradesh account for almost 70% of India's shrimp output.
* Women account for 70% of the 8 million-odd jobs in the sector, including 2 lakh in hatcheries and aquaculture farms and the rest in processing and freezing units.
* India's share in the US shrimp market has risen from 21% to 40% in 2022-23, with shipments worth $2.4 billion.
