The Government has undertaken several initiatives to diversify markets and strengthen India’s seafood export sector. The Marine Products Export Development Authority (MPEDA), a statutory body under the administrative control of Department of Commerce is actively working to diversify seafood export markets by mounting trade delegations, organizing Buyer–Seller Meets, and participating in major international seafood fairs across Asia and Europe. Reverse Buyer–Seller Meets in Chennai and New Delhi in 2025 facilitated over 100 buyer–exporter interactions. MPEDA is conducting sensitization programmes on various FTAs to help exporters utilize new opportunities. Efforts are being taken by the Department of Commerce to fast-track FTA negotiations, especially with the EU, to resolve market-access issues. The Department of Fisheries, Government of India has held a series of meetings with the Embassies/High Commissions of Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia, Japan, Thailand, the United Kingdom and Russia. These discussions covered, inter-alia, strengthening trade relations, value addition, quality assurance, biosecurity and quality compliance, cold-chain improvements, processing, automation, R&D collaboration, and training and capacity-building.

The total financial assistance extended to shrimp farmers and exporters under various schemes during the last five years is given below:

* MPEDA operates a financial assistance scheme for the setting up of a mini laboratory in an approved processing plant/ handling center registered with MPEDA for testing fishery products. Under the scheme, financial assistance is released at a rate of 50% of the total cost incurred, subject to a maximum of Rs. 5 Lakh to the applicant. This scheme helps registered seafood exporters to implement effective in-process quality control. MPEDA has supported 8 units under the scheme during the past 5 years with total financial assistance of ₹24.07 lakhs.
* MPEDA’s Value Addition Scheme supports the establishment and upgradation of export-oriented facilities for value-added marine products across all coastal regions. The scheme promotes investment in seafood value addition, thereby strengthening India’s presence in global markets. During the last five years, MPEDA has supported 83 units with total financial assistance of ₹10,189.91 lakh.
* MPEDA implemented SHAPHARI certification programme aligning with FAO guidelines to ensure disease-free & antibiotic-free shrimp seed & farm produce and to promote Better Management Practices. Certified hatcheries and farms enhance the credibility of shrimp exports, with exporters using the certification as a trusted document in trade. 50% of the Audit & Testing cost will be borne by the MPEDA for hatcheries & there is no audit/testing fee to be borne by the farmers. Currently, 16 hatcheries and 344.21 hectares of farm area are certified under Shaphari, supporting high-health shrimp production in India. MPEDA operates a financial assistance scheme for enhancing disease free production and assuring quality of produce. The total assistance provided during the past 5 years is ₹328.995 lakhs for 84 beneficiaries.

The Department of Fisheries, Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying is implementing the flagship scheme Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) for a period of 5 years from FY 2020-21 to FY 2024-25, at a total outlay of Rs.20,050 crore. Under this flagship scheme, 34,788 infrastructure units have been established with a budget allocation of ₹2,403 crore. These include cold storage, retail and wholesale markets, fish kiosks, value-added product units, and post-harvest transportation facilities (refrigerated/ insulated vehicles, bikes, etc.). Further, infrastructure support has been strengthened through the Fisheries and Aquaculture Infrastructure Development Fund (FIDF), which has supported 15 major projects worth Rs. 208 crore, primarily focused on fish processing and cold-chain development.

The following steps have been taken to support shrimp farmers:

1. MPEDA has been organising various capacity building programmes in farmers through Trainings, Farmers Meets, Awareness Campaigns, Stakeholders meetings, farm monitoring, farm to farm level campaigns etc. to equip the farmers with recent farming technologies, stocking and pond management related issues, Better Management Practices, use of inputs etc.
2. MPEDA initiated the Aquaculture Technician Training programmes to educate farmers through technicians on latest guidelines, the necessity to use only permitted & authorised and known inputs in farming and to adopt Better Management Practices in aquaculture for meeting the standards for food safety and export.
3. RGCA, the technology transfer wing of MPEDA, has been implementing domestication of tiger shrimp in RGCA’s Pilot Scale Brood Stock Multiplication Facility at Visakhapatnam for the production of SPF tiger shrimp broodstock from Indian strains. The project is currently supplying Tiger Shrimp broodstock to hatcheries for seed production. Aquaculture pathology lab established by the RGCA is also assisting farmers in disease diagnosis, prevention and control. The Mobile lab established by the RGCA provides instant support to the farmers in the field at times of distress.
4. MPEDA implemented SHAPHARI Certification of farms and hatcheries to assure that the products are antibiotic-free and disease free, produced through Best Management Practices.
5. MPEDA-RGCA operates the Aquatic Quarantine Facility (AQF) at Chennai to ensure that SPF shrimp brooders imported into the country are quarantined before supplying to hatcheries, in order to ensure disease-free farming operations.
6. MPEDA established an Aqua Farmers Call Centre with Toll Free Number at Vijayawada with experienced technical experts to deal with difficulties of farmers and to address the issues and to extend technical supports.
7. MPEDA is enrolling aquaculture farms and hatcheries for the purpose of traceability of produce intended for export.
8. MPEDA implements the financial assistance schemes for enhancing disease free production and assuring quality of produce, details attached as Annexure.
9. MPEDA has introduced a new scheme called Advanced Technological Transformation in Aquaculture to enhance shrimp production using bio-secured circular tanks. Under this scheme, financial assistance is provided at 50% of the capital cost up to ₹30 lakh for General Category farmers, and 75% of the capital cost up to ₹45 lakh for farmers belonging to SC/ST/NER/UTs during the year.
10. Department of Fisheries, Government of India has conducted series of meetings with stakeholders for ensuring optimal utilization of Central Schemes such as Fisheries and Aquaculture Development Fund (FIDF) and Pradhan Mantri Matsya Kisan Samridhi Sah-Yojana (PM-MKSSY) for development of modern infrastructure, cold chain, hatcheries, processing, and value-chain efficiencies.

In the 56th GST Council Meeting held on 3rd September, 2025, the Government of India approved the reduction of GST rates from 12-18% to 5% on over 20 fisheries and aquaculture-related products such as farm equipment, feed ingredients, water conditioners, fishing nets and value-added seafood products etc. This measure is expected to lower input costs, ease operational expenses, and enhance production, value addition, and competitiveness of Indian seafood.
