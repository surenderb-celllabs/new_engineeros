## Reviews
### Nito Lugo
Was a pretty great app for tracking. Emphasis on WAS. Now you can only add a handful of expenses before they lock you out and require their "Pro" subscription. They also make you wait a 10 second timer before adding each expense unless you have "Pro". This isn't how it was before, so it's pretty scummy business practices to change it to be predatory like this, after all this time using it. Time to look for alternative apps.

### Rajesh Ramsaroop
Great idea, but super confusing. I use it with my partner to track expenses that we owe each other. You can only pay balances to them in full and they push you to use their own payment platform. I want to be able to pay individual expenses, mark them as paid, not mark the entire balance as paid. It's too confusing to track how much I've paid for each expense, vs. how much is owed to me.

### CT Trumann
doesn't simplify expenses, so if you owe someone $10 in one group and they owe you $20 in another, it's not possible in-app to settle it in one $10 transaction. developers deliberately enshittified their app and removed features to make them available only to paid subscribers. wouldn't recommend setting up on this app if you're not already using it.
