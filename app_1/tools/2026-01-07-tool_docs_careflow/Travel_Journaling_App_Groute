# I Built a Travel Journaling App Groute That Actually Makes Sense - Would Love Your Feedback!
## Introduction
Hey r/PKMS, 
I got tired of juggling between Google Photos, Maps, Notes, and trying to remember "wait, what did I do after that cafe in Paris?" when telling travel stories. I built this app called Groute that automatically connects your photos by location and time to create visual travel routes.

## How it Works
Here's the hook: Just upload your travel photos → GPS data creates your journey path automatically → Add quick 30-character thoughts → Share as beautiful web pages that friends can actually explore.
Think of it as your travel memories getting the "connect the dots" treatment, but way cooler.

## What Makes it Different
* Your route appears instantly as you add photos (no manual plotting!)
* Map-first approach - location is the main navigation, not date folders
* 30-character limit on notes (forces you to capture the essence, not write essays)
* Creates shareable journey pages that work like mini travel guides
* Built this because I'm convinced that location + time + moment = perfect travel memory, and most apps only handle one of these well.

## Call for Feedback
Currently in beta and would genuinely love to get some feedback from fellow travelers who actually get the pain of organizing travel memories!
If you're interested in trying it out, comment below or DM me! Especially looking for feedback from people who travel frequently or have that "I have 10,000 unorganized travel photos" problem.
What do you think? Does this solve a real problem or am I just overthinking travel journaling? 

## Additional Information
P.S. - The app shows Paris in the screenshots but works anywhere your phone can GPS tag photos. Been testing it everywhere from Seoul coffee shops to Patagonian highways!
