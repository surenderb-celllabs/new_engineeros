# Why Can Chess Feel So Personal and Painful to Lose At?
## Forum Discussion
The following discussion took place on the Chess.com forums:

* **AndyClifton** (Mar 25, 2013): heehee!
* **Lucidish_Lux** (Mar 25, 2013): I had a CC game recently where I played well, but blundered a simple skewer, losing my rook and the game. I kicked myself for a minute, but then I thought, "oh well--he did well to play on and catch my mistake."
* **Knightly_News** (Apr 20, 2013): Different reasons to get angry. Sometimes it's the element of being surprised or outsmarted, particularly when you thought you'd win. Or you blunder a game you have a strong lead at and an 'inferior' player beats you.
* **jcraig9218** (Apr 20, 2013): Face it. It's our pride at stake. We commit time and invest our emotions in the endeavor. It's combat with only our own intelligence and vision at play. If we didn't care about the outcomes we wouldn't be here. The more we care, the more it hurts to lose. Failure is difficult to swallow. The pain is actually a sign of a healthy ego.
* **Aetheldred** (Apr 20, 2013): I like what jcraig9218 said: "The pain is actually a sign of a healthy ego."
* **conejiux** (Apr 20, 2013): Ego isn't healthy in any form.
* **Aetheldred** (Apr 20, 2013): One of the synonyms of ego is "self-esteem".
* **MyCowsCanFly** (Apr 20, 2013): Pain is relative. It's not like the result of mistakes in auto racing, bull fighting, or mountain climbing.
* **conejiux** (Apr 20, 2013): Self esteem can be a dangerous illusion.
* **jcraig9218** (Apr 20, 2013): Conejiux, ego and self esteem are just terms used to identify a psychological phenomenon. They're neutral, without positive or negative connotations.
* **DrFrank124c** (Apr 20, 2013): When I make a stupid move I get mad at myself! But I know that some people get really angry when they lose a game.
* **NimzoRoy** (Apr 20, 2013): There's no one size fits all answer here. One of my pals told me in all seriousness each game should be treated as a matter of life and death.
* **bean_Fischer** (Apr 20, 2013): Nobody likes to be #2. Nobody likes losing. I don't know about being personal. I don't even remember my opponent name, let alone his face. But painful, yes.

* **landwehr** (Apr 20, 2013): doggone great
* **landwehr** (Apr 20, 2013): it really hurts when beaten by an inferior opponent...but like a professional sportsmen just move on to the next game, the next tourney
* **landwehr** (Apr 20, 2013): if losing a game of chess hurts...then, like falling off a horse they say it is best to get back into the saddle as soon as possible...so as quickly as possible, lose another game of chess...but to a higher rated player!
* **conejiux** (Apr 20, 2013): OOOOOOMMMMMMM...
* **AndyClifton** (Apr 20, 2013): OOOOOOOMMMMMMMGGGGGGG...
* **GambitExtraordinaire** (Apr 20, 2013): It is because there is no luck involved in chess. When you sit down at the board across from your opponent, both of you know about this absence of luck. It is a Battle! A battle of wits, and creativity, and strategy. And if you lose, you have nobody to blame but yourself. That is why it can sting. Few people derive pleasure from the knowledge that somebody just plain played better than they did.
