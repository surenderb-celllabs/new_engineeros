# Understanding Pain Points in Game Design
Pain Points are often the understated killer of many games, and we're going to discuss how to spot them and some common mistakes for developers to avoid.

## Defining Pain
The concept of spotting pain points in videogames is not something that is often talked about among consumers and reviewers. What we are referring to are elements in a videogame that either break the illusion of the experience or make the game worse to play.

## User Tolerance
Everyone has a tolerance level to frustration when it comes to a game, and each time they run into something that would be considered a pain point, it begins a tally for them. Without realizing it, once a game’s pain point level reaches the person’s internal limit, they just stop playing.

## Reducing Pain
Spotting pain points in a game begin and end at the user experience. As always—anything that interferes or prevents someone from experiencing your core gameplay loop is a pain point. For ARPGs, a common one is not having a sort feature for inventories full of items.

## Common Pain Points
* Lack of audio sliders
* No control rebindings
* Poor user interface and user experience (UI/UX) issues
* Tutorial design and basic onboarding issues
* Annoying sound bites that repeat constantly
* Difficulty spikes rather than pain points

## Identifying Pain Points
Part of the challenge of identifying pain points is that they are often conflated together with other issues. Asking someone about what is annoying them in a game is kind of like asking a patient what is wrong with them. People can talk about the symptoms, but they will not be able to tell a doctor what they have.

## Playtesting
If you want to know if your game has pain points, put it in the hands of consumers and see if they complain about anything. Remember, you not only want fans of the genre to play your game but non-fans or critics who are more receptive to pain points.

## Conclusion
Designing a game in a bubble is the easiest way to make a pain point-filled experience. With playtesting, one playtest session is not enough: you want multiples and with different groups. And again, you are going to have to take all the feedback, especially the ones that are not going to be nice. A good videogame is always about being greater than the sum of its parts, and pain points subtract from that.
