"We are a group of 6-10 friends who are travel enthusiasts and do a lot of trips together.

## Reviews
### Amy Gangl
* Rating: 3/5
* Review: "I think this is geared more towards tracking expenses that you're going to split among multiple people, so keep that on mind before downloading. I only needed something to track my expenses on a solo trip. A major downside is that it makes you manually enter an exchange rate for each transaction, which is frustrating when you're just trying to add expenses quickly. The trip list is nice, but the UI on the transactions is not user-friendly."

* Review: "This is a great app. Thanks to the developer, but I would like to suggest a few modifications. This app counts equal expense sharing. But if anyone agrees to pay a certain percentage of a particular expense (e.g. 80% of food, 60% of room rent, etc.); that could not be possible to count in this app. I hope the developer can update this issue (the expense screen of the app). Thanks once again."

* Review: "EXACTLY what I was looking for! Great app! I went on a golf vacation with 4 guys and everyone chipped in for rental vehicle, gas, groceries etc. It keeps a record of each entry (who spent what) and you can output an excel sheet at the end and send to the rest of your group outlining who owes what to who... It doesn't matter if you have to enter different currencies (eg a trip through several countries) -it will convert it all to your default currency for that particular trip (which you enter at the beginning of the session) -when the trip was over, I sent each guy the excel sheet, they sent me e-transfers, and everyone was happy. I would gladly pay for this app... even better that it's free, but I'm not one of those that wants everything for nothing."
