# Most horrible travel expense application ever!
## Introduction
Hello Concur community, Concur employees, and users! My name is Chris, and I am a very, very frustrated Concur expense report user. This Concur expense software is probably the worst app I've even worked with, in the past 5-10 years, if not forever.

## Issues with Concur
* The tool is NOT user-friendly, it is NOT intuitive, and the silliness of details is astronomical.
* It takes 3+ hours to fill out an expense report, worth approximately $1,000.
* The process is unnecessarily arduous and opaque, not at all user-friendly and intuitive.

* @ChrisSharp, I wanted to reply so you knew that someone from SAP Concur has read your post.
* We have a program specifically for customers to provide feedback, the CEI Program.
* I would like to hear more about one of your statements where you said, "the silliness of details is astronomical".

* I created an account just to say AMEN, it’s as if Concur was created to disincentivize employees from submitting their expense reports.
* An unnecessarily arduous and opaque process, not at all user-friendly and intuitive.

### MiserableUser
* Yup, I created my account to agree with how awful using SAP-Concur has been—the experience is demoralizing A-Z.
* It takes money as well as time out of pocket and changes the work experience for the worse.

### kbredder
* Totally, that thought crossed my mind when I was granted a Holiday Lunch for $25 and turned it down knowing the expense reimbursement process absolutely was NOT worth it!

### jlvollmer
* I have to agree with the other posters, my blood pressure goes up every time I have to submit a report.
* It is not intuitive at all, it’s confusing how to do just about anything.

### russellsnow
* As a user of the SAP Concur expense system, I appreciate its robust features and capabilities, but the user experience could be significantly enhanced by integrating spreadsheet functionalities into the interface.
* The ability to import and export data from and to Excel would be a valuable addition.

## Conclusion
The SAP Concur community is filled with frustrated users who are experiencing difficulties with the expense report system. The issues range from user-friendliness to intuitiveness, and the community is calling for changes to be made to improve the overall experience.
