# Understanding Smart Lighting: How it Works, the Features & Benefits
## Introduction
With almost all home appliances and electronics getting smarter, why should lighting be an exception? Today, you can dim the lights in your home with a simple voice command, a remote controller or an app on your smartphone. Your motion sensor lights will help you reach the kitchen safely when you want to get out of bed in the middle of the night to get water. These and many more types of lighting come under the ambit of smart lighting.

## What is a Smart Lighting System?
Smart lighting is a system of advanced lighting technology. The lights in a smart lighting system comprise software that connects to an app on your smartphone or other smart devices in your home, allowing you to automate your lights. This way, you can eliminate the need to flip a switch. 
These smart lighting systems are integrated with a myriad of features including colour changing, scheduled on and off, auto-dimming and essential lighting, among others. Smart lights can be potentially energy-efficient and cost-effective in the long run.

## How Does Smart Lighting Work?
Like most automated systems, smart lighting systems use wireless technology that allows you to control the lights remotely. The smart lights connect to a central controller which can be a hub or a software. The smart light receives instructions from this hub. The hub acts as a gateway between the smart light and your smartphone. 
Smart bulbs and smart LED battens are typically not connected to a central controller or hub. Instead, you can control them using the internet. When you control these smart lights using your phone or smart speaker, you are essentially sending instructions to these lights over the internet.
