# Circadian Lighting
## Introduction
The human system is designed to derive energy from a balance between light and darkness, with daylight playing a pivotal role. Any disruption in this balance can have a negative impact on our well-being.

## What is Circadian Lighting?
Circadian lighting replicates the beneficial effects of natural light. It automatically adjusts throughout the day, providing a gentle sunrise and strong daylight to establish a healthy circadian rhythm, boost energy, and improve sleep.

## Advantages of Circadian Lighting
Maintaining a healthy circadian rhythm is crucial for our bodies to thrive and stay well. The advantages of circadian lighting include:
* Better sleep: Soft lighting in the evening and darkness at night create optimal conditions for a restful night's sleep.
* Anti-depression: A proper balance between light and darkness promotes a stable circadian rhythm and reduces depression.
* More energy: Intense daylight fuels the body and mind with energy throughout the waking hours of the day.
* Increase health: Properly utilized light preserves the body's natural processes and enhances well-being.
