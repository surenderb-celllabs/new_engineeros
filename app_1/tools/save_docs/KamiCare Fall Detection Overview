KamiCare aims to build a camera-based fall detection system for elderly care homes. The system will capture body positions, detect falls, and send alerts to the caregiver assigned to each resident. It also plans to involve other stakeholders like family members, nurses, and administration. The goal is to provide timely alerts to improve resident safety.
