problem_statement: |
  The product targets modern travelers—solo adventurers, friends traveling together, and 
  business professionals—who routinely juggle a growing volume of travel memories and expenses.  
  During a trip, they capture photos, videos, voice notes, and receipts in an ad‑hoc, fragmented way, 
  often using separate apps or manual spreadsheets.  Once the trip ends, the need to reconcile 
  shared costs and generate a coherent itinerary or summary becomes a painful, time‑consuming chore 
  that forces users to re‑enter data or rely on unreliable spreadsheets.  Workarounds such as piecing 
  together receipts in a shared document or using generic note‑taking apps fail to provide a 
  contextual, timeline‑anchored view, leading to frustration, lost memories, and missed opportunities 
  for sharing or corporate reporting.  The real‑world impact is a significant waste of hours spent 
  on bookkeeping, fragmented storytelling, and a lack of trust in the accuracy of shared expenses, 
  which ultimately deters users from fully engaging with the travel community or from adopting the 
  app as a primary travel companion.

  The root problems stem from three core friction points: (1) the absence of a single, seamless 
  capture layer that records media, expenses, and memories together; (2) a cumbersome post‑trip 
  expense reconciliation workflow that is not automated or intuitive; and (3) a lack of AI‑powered 
  itinerary planning and summarization that can transform raw data into publishable narratives.  
  These issues are compounded by the need for offline resilience, granular privacy controls, and 
  the ability to share content publicly or privately.  Addressing them requires distinct, high‑level 
  capabilities that can be built, measured, and iterated independently.

solutions: |
  The solution is a unified travel diary platform that stitches together a timeline‑anchored capture 
  engine, an automated expense reconciliation engine, an AI‑enhanced itinerary generator, and an 
  AI‑driven summarization service, all wrapped in a privacy‑first design that works offline and 
  syncs seamlessly.  Users begin a trip by tapping a single “capture” button that records photos, 
  videos, voice notes, and receipts, automatically tagging them with timestamp, location, and optional 
  categories.  As the trip unfolds, each entry appears in a chronological feed, and users can flag 
  visibility (private, friends‑only, public).  After the trip, a guided split wizard pulls receipts, 
  groups costs, and offers multiple split strategies, auto‑generating a final report that can be 
  exported to corporate accounting software.  Parallel to this, the AI itinerary engine ingests the 
  captured data to suggest daily plans, while the AI summarizer produces concise narratives for 
  each day, location, and the entire trip, which can be shared directly to social feeds or kept 
  private.  Offline capture is handled by local caching, with automatic sync when connectivity 
  returns, ensuring no loss of data.  This end‑to‑end flow eliminates the need for separate tools, 
  reduces manual entry, and delivers immediate, shareable value to travelers.
