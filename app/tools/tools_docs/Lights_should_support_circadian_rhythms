# Lights should support circadian rhythms: evidence-based scientific consensus
## Abstract
For over a hundred years, the lighting industry has primarily been driven by illumination aesthetics, energy efficiency, and product cost with little consideration of the effects of light on health. The recent widespread replacement of traditional light sources by blue-enriched LED lights has heightened concerns about the disruption of the blue-sensitive human circadian system by these LED lights and their impact on the multiple health disorders linked to circadian disruption.

## 1 Introduction
The timing, duration, intensity, and spectral composition of ocular light exposure have a profound effect on circadian clocks and rhythmic physiological processes. For over 10,000 generations of Homo sapiens, the contrast between bright daylight and nocturnal darkness robustly entrained the human circadian timing system to the Earth’s 24-h rotation. However, for less than four generations over the past century, the natural 24-h cycle of daylight and darkness at night has been replaced in the developed world by electric light.

## 2 Method
### 2.1 Survey population
A search of PubMed with the terms “circadian” + “light” identified 10,002 peer-reviewed scientific articles published between 1 April 2008 and 1 April 2022 by 29,455 unique authors. We identified all the authors out of this sample who had published four or more peer-reviewed articles, and we built an email list of 2,142 authors using their most recent identifiable email addresses on academic and publisher websites.

### 2.2 Survey design
Forty statements were developed for testing by the authors of this article. Thirty were potential factual conclusions summarizing the scientific literature with the following response options: 1) Don’t Know, 2) No Evidence, 3) Limited Evidence, 4) Good Evidence, or 5) Well-Established.

### 2.3 Definition of consensus
In a large and diverse group of scientists addressing complex scientific questions, achieving unanimous agreement is not feasible or expected. In Delphi health policy consensus studies, where there are several rounds of feedback between participants enabling participants to change their minds and refine their answers based on new data and the judgments of their peers, 70%–75% agreement is often accepted as consensus. In this single iteration survey, with no opportunity to revise answers based on feedback from other participants, we defined a consensus as when two-thirds of the respondents (66.7%) supported the statement.

## 3 Results
Consensus was reached on 25 out of the 40 test statements. The first set of consensus statements related to the role of regular exposure to bright light during the day in enhancing the robust entrainment of circadian rhythms and maintaining health. There was strong consensus that robust circadian rhythms are important for health (95.1%) and that disrupting circadian rhythms can cause ill health (98.4%).

## 4 Discussion
A consensus survey, such as this, serves a different purpose than a literature review or a meta-analysis. It asked 248 scientists who have had significant research and publication experience in circadian rhythms and light interactions over the past 15 years on what can be considered established science in this field, and where there are still open questions that will require additional research to resolve.

The 248 scientists participating in this Consensus Survey, who each had published multiple peer-reviewed articles addressing the interactions between light and the circadian system, reached a clear consensus that “there is now sufficient evidence to support the widespread introduction of circadian lighting that adjusts light intensity and blue content across day and night to maintain robust circadian entrainment and health”. This conclusion was supported by consensus on 24 other specific statements about the disruptive effects of light at night, and the lack of adequate light during the day, on circadian rhythms and health.
