## Complaint Management Software
Complaint management software allows entry, tracking, recording, and recalling customer contact history to better customer experience and customer complaint handling. Complaints regularly occur in businesses and organizations. With growing regulatory oversight, multiple teams, not just customer service staff, may receive and report complaints to industry regulators.

### Objective of Complaint Management System
The main objective of implementing the online customer management system is to remove the challenges while dealing with customers and their issues. An online complaint system is a useful solution for sorting out issues in a systematic manner. It saves time in clearing up issues efficiently to the logged complaints, into a web-based customer management system.

### Approach of the Customer Support Team
The customer support team approaches customers' complaints with patience, while registering them into the online complaint system. Customer support executives use the online customer management system in their support calls. The submission of complaints into the online customer complaint system initiates an email shared with the customers, giving them peace of mind and enabling them to know that their complaints have been received and will be taken care of shortly.

### Benefits of Complaint Management Software
