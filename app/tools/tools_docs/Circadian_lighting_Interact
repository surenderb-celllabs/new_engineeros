# Circadian Lighting
## Introduction
Improve well-being and light in step with the body’s circadian rhythm. The role light plays in our day-to-day experience cannot be overstated. Lack of light, and even lack of the right light, has been proven to disrupt the human circadian rhythm, which regulates the daily sleep-wake cycle. This can lead to a variety of health problems—stress, sleep deprivation and depression to name but a few.

## How it Works
Circadian lighting uses dynamic LED luminaires—tunable white and full-color— and evidence-based lighting recipes (dynamic lighting scenes) to improve mood, performance, and overall well-being.

### Set the Tone
Lighting recipes are specially designed to work in tandem with the body’s circadian rhythm, with each recipe scientifically validated to produce or enhance specific positive outcomes. Use these recipes—which rely on distinctive, slowly-changing combinations of color and intensity—to influence your employees or customers to focus, relax, concentrate, or even wake up effectively and reliably.
