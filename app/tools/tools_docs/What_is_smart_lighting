# What is Smart Lighting? A Complete Guide
## Introduction to Smart Lighting
Smart lighting is a more advanced way to light your home. In this article, we will explore how smart lights work, the different technologies used, and the benefits of smart lighting.

## How Do Smart Lights Work?
Smart lights have a chip inside them that allows them to communicate with other devices wirelessly. Every light can connect to an app, smart home assistant, or other smart accessory, enabling automation, color change, and remote control. Unlike conventional lights, which can only turn on or off, smart lights offer more features and flexibility.

## Smart Lighting Technology
There are multiple technologies that make a light smart, including:
* **Zigbee**: a secure, low-power wireless communication protocol that allows smart devices to "talk" to each other.
* **Wi-Fi**: a popular technology for smart lighting that uses the home's Wi-Fi network to communicate with devices.
* **Bluetooth**: a wireless communication technology that uses RF signals to send data, easy to use and accessible, but with limited range and data storage.

### Comparison of Zigbee, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth
| Technology | Requires Hub | Control Lights from Anywhere | Works Even When Wi-Fi is Down |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Zigbee | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Wi-Fi | No | Yes | No |
| Bluetooth | No | No | Yes |

## What is a Smart Hub?
A smart hub creates a super-fast Zigbee network between smart lights and connects them to the internet. This enables features like automation, voice control, and remote access. In the Philips Hue system, there are two hubs: the Bridge and Bridge Pro.

## LED Technology
Smart lights are often LED-based because:
1. LEDs don't heat up, which could damage the smart chip.
2. LEDs already have internal electronics, making it easy to include the smart chip.
3. LEDs can produce millions of light colors.
4. LEDs are energy-efficient and the current standard in home lighting.

## RGB, RGBA, RGBW, and RGBWW Lights
* **RGB lights**: mix red, green, and blue LEDs to create a wide variety of colors.
* **RGBIC lights**: have an independent controller, allowing individual control of different LEDs.
* **RGBA lights**: use amber in addition to red, green, and blue to display a wider range of yellow light.
* **RGBW lights**: feature a warm white chip to include thousands of additional shades of white light.
* **RGBWW lights**: have two different white LEDs, enabling richer colors.

## Benefits of Smart Lighting
The benefits of smart lighting include:
* **Convenience**: lights that do what you want, when you want.
* **Voice control**: adjust lights with a command.
* **Automations**: schedule lights to go on and off at certain times.
* **Easy dimmable light**: dimming is built-in, no special switch required.
* **Surround lighting**: sync lights to TV or computer content.
* **Cool light effects**: make lights sparkle, mimic a fireplace, or twinkle like stars.
* **Connect with other devices**: use smart lighting with other connected devices.
