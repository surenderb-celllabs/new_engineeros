## What Our Clients Say About Us
* "Our company develops CRM systems. We used to use the Zendesk help desk system, but then had to migrate to a Pulsedesk solution. Our key requirements were to have the ability to receive and process inquiries from email and chat on our site, as well as a built-in Knowledge Base. The choice fell on PulseDesk, which met all our criteria." - Anand Malik, Co-owner Klientiks
* "We were looking for a system to automate our service. We needed to receive messages from email and set up routing so that our employees were assigned to inquiries automatically. We considered several different solutions and chose PulseDesk, since its functionality almost completely covers our needs." - Travis Dunlop, Head of Service Support Top Delivery
* "We are very pleased that we chose PulseDesk. The service combines customer inquiries from various channels, which is very convenient. The functions make it possible to work faster and more efficiently." - Chris Michalak, Projects manager in Valalto
* "We’d never used help desk systems before, but at some point it became obvious that having automated support would speed up and simplify many processes. We analyzed the market, compiled a list of the most suitable solutions, and decided on PulseDesk, as it provided all of the functionality we needed at a very pleasant price." - Amit Jaine, Head of Customer Support in Integra
