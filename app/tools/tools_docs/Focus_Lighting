# About Us
At Focus Lighting, we create value by adding beauty and functionality to illumination.
Founded in 2005, our comprehension of lighting has always begun from the point of its association with the environment . At Focus, we are committed to innovate lighting technology in the relation of the environment it influences, creating desire at the point of sale. With this keen sensibility and extensive research, we develop holistic retail lighting solutions that meet the highest international standards in terms of technology as well as aesthetics.

## Our Approach
Our comprehension of lighting technology starts with exploring light in all its diverse forms. It enables us to design lighting solutions that deliver value by adding beauty and functionality to illumination. At the core of our lighting philosophy are; form, emotion and function.

## Research and Development
For the past few years, Focus has invested in a highly advanced R&D and testing facility in Mumbai. Our light fittings are subjected to a wide variety of test procedures; including tasks we carry out in our in-house Photometry Lab equipped with a full-field goniophotometer and a spectroradiometer with a 2-meter integrated sphere. This enables us to create even better, more energy efficient and higher quality products for our customers in the future.
