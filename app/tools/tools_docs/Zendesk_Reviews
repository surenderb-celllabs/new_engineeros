  The search engine has lots of room for improvement. Changing columns and searching for specific artifacts separate from the search bar should be implemented. Open ticket tabs should be moveable with...

  I'm quite disappointed in the support we are getting from Zendesk.  Sure, there's growth and change, but the Zendesk product support is quick to dismiss all of our issues as either user error or that...

  Not a well rounded or well thought-out product offering. Lots of customisation needed to get close to what you need in a modern support environment.
* Dean Mason - Jul 3, 2025
  The base plans seem good for what they are, but add-ons can make it very expensive. I'm glad the marketplace offers alternatives, but it's still a little disappointing that I can't get what I need (at...

  ExpressVPN started using it and support is just terrible. Answering slowly, pretending that the issue doesn't exist, asking the same information multiple times. After they don't have excuse their repl...

  We were not alerted in due time when your servers crashed/failed and we scrambled to find the source of the problem only to realize it was on your side 24-48 hours later.  Need to have Senior manager...
* MA - Mark - Dec 2, 2025 - Verified
  We sent in two tickets to request help with issues on reports and missing emails.  In the second ticket that we sent, we requested to be contacted as this was a RUSH.  It has been almost 2 weeks on t...

  I purchased these shoes after seeing a ad on Google search. There is NO mention in this ad THAT THESE SHOES ARE MADE IN CHINA AND IT WILL TAKE WEEKS TO RECEIVE THEM. DO NOT FALL FOR THIS SCAM! Custome...
* NI - Nick - Dec 13, 2025
  Zendesk is absurdly expensive, unnecessarily complicated, and has potentially the worst customer support I've ever worked with, which is ironic since they are literally a customer support plat...
* Jockomo - Jul 17, 2025
  Any Company that uses the interference of Zendesk instead of dealing with their customers directly are the epitome of much that's going wrong with this countrys digressively falling backwards....
* PE - Peter - Aug 12, 2025 - Verified
  Most horrible software, and most horrible, greediest, non-support company I've ever worked with.
  If I could go into negative stars, it'd be a clear -5.
  Funny that they sent me this invite for a rev...
* Joy Bucher - Sep 24, 2025
  My company started using their live chat feature about two years ago. From the non admin user side it’s a terrible experience. The notifications are completely unreliable and their support has been to...
* GE - Gerome - Aug 19, 2025
  Beware of rip-offs:
  Please stay away from Zendesk. Everything this company does is a rip-off. Promises are not kept. The software's features and add-ons are touted, but then they don't exist. You c...

  !!!Beware of Auto Subscriptions!!!
  We cancelled our subscription 3 years ago and have recently had £250 taken from us three years later direct from our bank account.  They say we didn't cancel!...

  this is the worst platform with horrible customer service, avoid it at all cost
* AJ - Ashley James - Jan 24, 2025
  I have been a customer of zendesk for years - I recently realized, 5 days into the year that I had 10 seats my company was not using. I asked them to kindly requote me for a reduced number of seats. S...

  Still getting used to the system.
  I find that I have to use many add-ons and workarounds to do basic tasks, and there's too much clicking involved. I guess some of this stuff is useful for a big te...
* Savannah Lobbe - Sep 11, 2025
  We signed up to Zendesk based on promises of phone and SMS functionality that turned out not to exist in the way they were sold. We even requested a trial of the phone feature before committing,...
* SI - Sinso - Nov 9, 2025
  Over the last two weeks I have many encounters with zendesk replies from 3 different retailers and I am not impressed. It is hard to know if it is a human or a bot dealing with your query because the...
* WM - Whitney Martin - Feb 24, 2025 - Invited
  All tickets do not always come to me so I have to look through the "unassigned" which takes so long, very easy to miss something because of that. Harder to keep up if someone responded to something th...
* Naila Khan - Feb 13, 2025
  The most horrible experience with Zendesk - the company is plain out thief. They connected a new feature "AI Agents" which is the bot that you as a client sets up. We, the client write articles for th...
* MA - Max Attila King - May 22, 2025
  Support is terrible, not helpful at all, they have no idea what they are doing. Once trial ends, they cancel the account, losing data and no option to subscribe anymore. Need to call support who is ab...
* Jai Long - Oct 24, 2025
  I reached out well before the renewal date for my subscription to cancel. They say it needs to be 30 days before the renewal date, so they can't cancel and I have to pay another year. This is comple...

  No reply from Zendesk financial team for a week and a half - they said a week and a half ago that they are checking on our invoice and then disappeared. We have sent 5 email replies since then with no...

  Zendesk, the AI only support company charging real human prices. If you need assistance with Zendesk and AI is not able to resolve your issue or answer the question, no one with any element of human i...
* Troy Redding - May 30, 2025
  Customer support is completely useless. We have multiple tickets open and it takes them forever to contact us. When they do contact you the solutions they offer are not helpful or relevant.
* PR - P. R. - Jul 12, 2025
  We’ve been using Zendesk for months, and while the platform is technically still supported and updated, it honestly feels like something developed 15 or 20 years ago. The interface is outdated,...
