## What is a Conversational AI Platform?
A conversational AI platform is a software that facilitates creating, training, and deploying self-service conversational tools such as chatbots, voice bots, and virtual agents. These platforms empower organizations to build intelligent and interactive AI agents capable of engaging in natural language conversations at scale.

## How Does a Conversational AI Tool Work?
A conversational AI tool operates through various advanced processes, harnessing machine learning and deep neural networks to enable seamless human-computer interactions. The process involves:

1. **Input Interface**: Users interact with the tool through text input or speech.
2. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: NLP extracts the user's intent from the text by breaking down the language into structured data.
3. **Natural Language Understanding (NLU)**: NLU refines this data by analyzing the text's grammar, context, and meaning to comprehend the user's intent and entities involved.
4. **AI Model and Natural Language Generation (NLG)**: The AI model uses this structured data to predict the best response based on the user's intent and training data. NLG then generates a human-like reaction.
