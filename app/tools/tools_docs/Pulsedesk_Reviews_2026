## Reviews
* **btolle**: 5/5 tacos
 + I've been looking for a LTD help desk solution for a while and Pulsedesk is the one that finally meets my needs.
 + The ticket system is super simple and works well, capturing screenshots and attachments with ease.
 + The SMTP and email system works flawlessly, responding to tickets in a way that shows up in the same thread as the original email.
 + The only gripe is the lack of webhook alerts, but this can be worked around with email alerts and Pabbly.
* **allan16**: 1/5 tacos
 + I decided to give up on Pulsedesk after waiting for support to set up my CNAME, which took too long.
 + Most platforms have this service built into the admin panel and it normally takes a couple of hours max.
* **Ahmet65920**: 5/5 tacos
 + Pulsedesk is an outstanding platform that is highly user-friendly and has exceptionally helpful customer support.
 + It truly stood out and exceeded all my expectations.
* **joshuarozario**: 2/5 tacos
 + Pulsedesk falls short in delivering a satisfying experience, with many features not functioning well or being poorly thought through.
 + The agent can never go offline, which misleads customers into thinking the agent is available for chat when they're not.
 + The customer support is slow and lacks proper training.
* **vipPLUS**: 1/5 tacos
 + The support is slow and it takes 2-3 days to reply to an email.
 + The CNAME function is advertised but cannot be used with your own domain name.
 + The structure is complicated when creating articles, requiring up to three sub-directories.
