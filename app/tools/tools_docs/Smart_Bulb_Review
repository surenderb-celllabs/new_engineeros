I bought 14 smart bulbs and tested them all out - detailed review!

I compared 14 different smart bulbs, focusing on local control, brightness, and color accuracy.

Watch the full video here, but in summary:
* Best high-end bulb: LiFX Color
* Best bright bulb: Wyze Color Bulb
* Best for price: Kasa 1000 lumen
* Best mid-range bulb: Yeelight 1S

I hope this helps if you're in the market for smart bulbs!
