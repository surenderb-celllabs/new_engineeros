# White Screen on Windows After Building React + Electron App (Works Fine on Ubuntu)
## Issue Description
The app installs successfully on Windows, but opens to a blank white screen. No UI elements are visible, and the tray icon does not appear.

### Tech Stack
* Frontend: React.js
* Backend: Electron (main process)
* Bundler: Webpack
* Packaging: electron-builder
* OS: Ubuntu 22.04 (working), Windows 10/11 (not working)

### Issue Details
* App installs successfully on Windows, but opens to a blank white screen
* No UI elements are visible
* Tray icon does not appear
* No errors during the build process
* Works perfectly in development environment

### What I've Tried
* Verified that main.js and preload.js are included in the build
* Confirmed that index.html is being bundled correctly by Webpack
* Enabled DevTools via webPreferences: { devTools: true } — but nothing renders
* Ran the .exe as administrator
* Checked for missing assets or build resources
* Compared Linux and Windows builds for discrepancies

### Code Snippets
#### preload.js
```javascript
const { contextBridge, ipcRenderer } = require("electron");

contextBridge.exposeInMainWorld("ipcRenderer", {
  send: (channel, data) => ipcRenderer.send(channel, data),
  on: (channel, callback) =>
    ipcRenderer.on(channel, (event, ...args) => callback(...args)),
});
```

#### package.json
```json

## Solution
The problem was in the `package.json` under the build section, where the necessary files for the production build were not being included. The `dist` folder, which contains the Webpack output, was not being bundled, causing the `.exe` to launch but fail to display anything, resulting in a blank Electron window.

### Fix
Updated the `files` array in the build config to explicitly include the required assets:
```json
"files": [
  "main.js",
  "dist/**/*",
  "public/**/*"
]
```
