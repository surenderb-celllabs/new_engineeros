## Introduction
An efficient ticket management process is one of the most critical elements to get right in your operational journey. With 75% of buyers stating customer service as the most important factor in their choice to make repeat purchases, it is clear that customer satisfaction rates can evolve your business to new heights or ruin your reputation fast.

## What is ticket routing in Zendesk?
Ticket routing ensures that requests and issues reach the right people at the right time, speeding up resolution time and creating ideal information flow across the company. While ticket routing often happens manually in smaller companies, ticket routing in Zendesk can create a more efficient process. Zendesk gives teams access to a centralized hub where items can automatically be tagged or assigned to individuals or teams based on filters or criteria.

## Benefits of ticket routing in Zendesk
1. **Increased productivity**: Automated ticket routing ensures that topic experts are utilized to answer the relevant questions at all times over generalists or experts of other areas.
2. **Shorter resolution time**: As experts can recall information instantly, they’re also able to answer subsequent questions that might arise from raised issues.
3. **Removing repetitive tasks**: With the help of automated ticket routing, actions can be skipped, allowing support agents to spend more time on the important stuff, such as providing in-depth information and superb customer service.
