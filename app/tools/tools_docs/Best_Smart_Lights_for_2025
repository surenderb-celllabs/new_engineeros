## What is the best smart light?
Wiz smart light bulbs offer an impressive range of tunable whites and a nifty trick of acting like motion sensors for automations.

## Best smart lights
Our top nine picks to consider this holiday season.

### Best all-around smart bulb
* **Wiz LED Smart Light Bulb (Color)**
	+ Pros: Very affordable, no hub required, Matter support for Alexa, Siri and Google Home, color changing, motion-sensing when multiple bulbs are added
	+ Cons: Not for every scenario like outdoor lighting, brightness is a little low at 800 lumens compared to some of my picks
	+ Why I like it: After testing more smart bulbs that I can count, I kept returning to this convenient Wiz bulb that had everything I wanted in a standard A19/E26 home bulb filled with smart features, all for about $10.

### Best smart BR30 floodlight
* **Philips Hue White and Color Ambiance Bulb**
	+ Pros: Great bulb design, useful app UI with quick mood and scene options without a lot of tinkering, lots of brightness options to choose from, white or color ambiance
	+ Cons: The bulb is already pricey at about $45 and requires an expensive hub to enable remote app controls
	+ Why I like it: Smart floodlight bulbs exist too and they’re perfect for larger indoor spaces.

### Best budget smart light
* **Wyze Bulb White 2-pack**
	+ Pros: Easy setup, very affordable, a handy group control option, fun sunlight-matching and similar settings, no hub needed
	+ Cons: No Apple support, no color options
	+ Why I like it: If you’re looking for a quick, cheap bulbs, especially a multi-bulb solution for several upgrades around your home, Wyze bulb packs don’t disappoint.

### Best high brightness smart bulb
* **Tapo Smart Wi-Fi Light Bulb, Multicolor**
	+ Pros: High 1,100 lumen brightness, Matter support for Alexa, Google Home and Siri, easy ways to change brightness or color temperature as needed
	+ Cons: Slightly more expensive than the most affordable smart bulbs unless you find it on sale
	+ Why I like it: Tapo’s bulb is another great smart color light that remains quite affordable.

### Best outdoor smart light
* **Lifx Color BR30 Bulb**
	+ Pros: IP65 weather resistance, 1,100 lumens, color changing, support for Alexa, Google Home, and Apple
	+ Cons: Won’t fit in every outdoor light space, like lights that need to be wired in
	+ Why I like it: Most smart home lighting is indoor-only bulbs, but I’ve tested a few outdoor models as well.

### Best smart light strip
* **Govee LED Strip Light**
	+ Pros: Smart color changing, expansive music syncing options with 11 modes, dozens of scenes for pre-made effects, multiple lengths
	+ Cons: Cannot be cut to size, so many modes may be confusing for some users
	+ Why I like it: I’ve been impressed with Govee light strips in the past, but this newer model is one of the best possible if you want to pick a light strip of a certain length while still giving it plenty of smarts.

### Best smart light panels
* **Govee Mini Panel Lights**
	+ Pros: Smart LED panels for colorful and imaginative displays, Govee’s light syncing and scenes options, Alexa and Google support, tech makes app controls for colors easy to use
	+ Cons: One panel will need to have a nearby plugin, no Apple support
	+ Why I like it: For a more entertaining, front-and-center smart lighting choice, this Govee smart panel set can be a centerpiece or an accompaniment to another display.

### Best solar smart light for outdoors
* **Ring Pathlight Solar**
	+ Pros: Solar powered, works with other Ring products and Alexa, simple setup
	+ Cons: Requires Ring Bridge
	+ Why I like it: Outdoor lighting is key to a safe and secure home, so upgrading to smart outdoor lights that double as motion detectors and sync with your security system makes a lot of sense.

### Best color-changing smart bulb
* **GE Cync Dynamic Effects BR30 Bulb (Update: Unavailable)**
	+ Pros: Unique four-part color lighting for imaginative lighting, no hub required, excellent app UI for controls
	+ Cons: No Apple support, slightly dim for a floodlight bulb
	+ Why I like it: I bet you’ve never seen a floodlight bulb quite like this before.

## Other smart lights we tested
* Kasa Smart Light Bulb: TP-Link’s Kasa brand bulb is another cheap and effective smart light option.
* Govee LED Smart Light Bulb: Govee’s color smart bulb is an excellent choice if you like to play with colors.
* Philips Hue White Ambiance Bulb: This white bulb is a fine example of Philips Hue lighting.
* Philips Hue Smart 75W A19 LED Bulb: Hue bulbs can be a good choice if you plan on getting a lot of them.
* Sengled Smart LED Color Changing Bulb: I’ve tested Sengled’s bulb and I like it, but it’s almost twice as expensive as other bulbs that do all the same things and requires a hub for full functionality.
* Lutron Caseta Original Smart Dimmer Switch: This dimmer switch tested very well, although I decided to leave it off a list focusing on the lights themselves.
* Sylvania Smart Plus: Much like Sengled, this light bulb is held back by the higher price and a need for a hub.
* Govee Envisual TV LED Backlight: This is, hands down, the best TV backlight I’ve ever seen and it’s almost scarily smart.
