# How can I track an article which is not useful for a customer?
## Freshdesk Support
When an article is published, there is a message at the bottom which says "Did you find it helpful?" which is basically a yes or no question. Upon giving a negative feedback, it creates a new ticket within the portal. Feedback on the article is visible in the Feedback section in the specific Article View page. This way you could resolve these tickets and address the negative feedback as well all from one place.
