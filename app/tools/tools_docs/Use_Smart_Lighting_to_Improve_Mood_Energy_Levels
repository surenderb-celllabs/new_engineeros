# Use Smart Lighting to Improve Mood & Energy Levels
## Introduction to Smart Lighting
Smart lighting is the latest advancement in lighting systems for homes, offices, industries, etc. We’ve come a long way from the era when oil lamps were lit for lighting. Electricity revolutionised lighting the way we see and experience it today. Today, we have plenty of options in lighting.

## Types of Lighting
They fall under the categories of:
* Ambient lighting, which finds use in everyday purposes
* Task lighting, which helps with specific tasks such as reading, writing, working
* Accent lighting, which highlights artworks or architectural details
* Decorative lighting, such as chandeliers

## Smart Lighting and Automation
Smart lighting incorporates technology along with different types of lighting to achieve automation. This makes the lighting process at your house or office easy. The smart lighting sensors detect sunrise, sunset, entry and exit of people, etc., and accordingly switches on/off the appropriate lights and adjusts its brightness. It can raise or regulate your mood and energy levels throughout the day.

## Benefits of Smart Lighting
Studies indicate that exposure to bright, blueish light can improve productivity, focus and alertness. However, exposure to dimmer, warmer lights can help the body relax by reducing stress and anxiety.

## Circadian Lighting Systems
Our body follows a circadian rhythm or cycle as part of the body’s internal clock, governing essential functions and processes. This cycle can face disruption due to external factors such as sleep, food, work or travel timings. Circadian lighting technology works along with our natural circadian rhythm. It syncs with our body’s natural sleep cycle adjusting the different aspects of lighting through the day.

## Benefits of Circadian Lighting
Exposure to bright blue light in the evenings affects your ability to fall asleep naturally. Smart lighting helps us sleep better by dimming the lights, adjusting the hues so that the body can relax and thus, get sound sleep. Not only do you sleep early, you stay asleep longer and wake up feeling refreshed.

### Key Findings
* A study conducted in 2017, says that smart lighting could help reduce the symptoms of Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) up to 50 %. It is linked to the natural outdoor light cycle.
* A report published by the US Department of Energy in 2020 says that a well-implemented smart lighting system can save 10-20 % of annual energy bills.

## Smart Lighting for Boosting Energy Levels
Smart lighting can help boost our energy levels during those periods of energy dips such as post lunch or when the sun is high up in the sky. Also, it can stimulate the production of cortisol associated with alertness and wakefulness. Additionally, integrating smart lighting systems with motion sensors automates the whole process. So, as we enter/exit the house or room, the lighting adjusts automatically to sync with our circadian rhythm.

## Conclusion
Therefore, smart lighting systems can be very helpful in our modern lifestyle and will continue to do so. Audio & Beyond is the best home automation showroom in Hyderabad. If you’re looking for smart lighting solutions, we’re a ring away.
