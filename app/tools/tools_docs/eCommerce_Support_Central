The Challenge: Deciphering Long and Complex Customer Messages
In customer service, agents often face lengthy, disorganised, or emotionally charged messages from customers. These complex support queries can take time to read, comprehend, and respond to, which slows down productivity and can frustrate agents and customers alike. 
With eCommerce scaling rapidly, support teams must manage a high volume of messages across multiple channels. Each ticket may include a mix of order details, complaints, follow-ups, and additional context – often hidden in paragraphs of text. This makes manual ticket analysis inefficient and inconsistent.
So, how can support teams understand long emails faster with AI?

## Introducing AI Ticket Summarisation
AI ticket summarisation uses artificial intelligence and natural language processing (NLP) to extract key points from customer messages, providing a short, digestible summary for agents. It’s an essential part of a helpdesk with AI ticket summarisation, enabling teams to handle support tickets faster and more accurately.

### How it Works (NLP Explained Simply)
AI summarisation tools like the one in eDesk’s AI Features use natural language processing to understand the structure and context of language. Instead of scanning every word, the AI models:
* Analyse intent and sentiment
* Identify critical information, such as order numbers, issues, or requests
* Summarise the core problem or query in a single sentence or bullet list

This smart support ticket analysis allows agents to grasp the customer’s needs in seconds.

## Benefits of Using AI Summaries in Customer Support
* Faster Comprehension and Response Times
* Reduced Average Handling Time (AHT)
* Improved Consistency in Understanding

## eDesk’s AI Summary Feature in Action
eDesk’s smart AI ticket summarisation helpdesk is designed to empower eCommerce support teams. Integrated into the Smart Inbox Functionality, AI summaries appear alongside incoming tickets, providing instant clarity.
Whether it’s a five-paragraph email about a delayed shipment or a complex billing issue with multiple touchpoints, eDesk’s AI surfaces the key facts so agents can jump straight to resolution.

## Tips for Leveraging AI Summaries Effectively
* Train agents to read the summary first, then use it to validate customer details quickly.
* Use summaries to prioritise tickets, especially for time-sensitive or high-value customers.
* Combine summaries with Boosting Agent Efficiency techniques like auto-tagging and sentiment detection.
* Review summaries for quality feedback – help AI learn from edge cases.

## FAQs
* How can AI help understand customer emails?
AI summarisation reads and processes long emails, identifying the intent, urgency, and core issue. This saves agents from manual reading and guessing.

Ticket summarisation is an AI-driven method of condensing support messages into concise summaries that highlight the most important parts of a customer’s query.
