## Using Generative AI for Customer Service Complaints
### Example 1: Price Increase Complaint
A customer, Rebecca, submits a complaint about an insurance premium increase. The complaint email is picked up by the business process management (BPM) solution, SS&C | Blue Prism Chorus. A digital worker utilizes generative AI to craft a response.

### Example 2: Poor Customer Service Complaint
A customer, Helen, lodges a complaint via email about poor customer service. The digital worker locates the reference to poor customer service and the representative involved, and gen AI composes an email containing the relevant data.

## Building the Complaint Process
The complaint process is built using Chorus, a low-code design framework that orchestrates the interactions between the gen AI, human workers, and digital workers.
