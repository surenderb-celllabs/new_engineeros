# Masked Man Gyökeres Quiets ‘Invisible’ Taunts to Leave an Impression at the Gunners
Should Viktor Gyökeres goes on to become the striker that each Arsenal followers have been praying for, then perhaps they will look back on this night as the juncture his destiny turned around. According to the classic forward’s saying, it isn’t important how they hit the back of the net.

## Stunning Reversal in Fortune
Following a streak of nine matches for club and country without a goal and expectations rising on the man brought in for a substantial sum in the close season, a massive sense of release swept over the Emirates Stadium when Gyökeres guided in from point-blank via a ricochet off David Hancko during a thrilling second half when Mikel Arteta’s side demonstrated once more that they mean business this season.

Shortly after and to the joy of the local supporters, his Bane-inspired gesture borrowed from the villain Bane in Batman, whose catchphrase is “attention came only with the disguise,” was repeated once more after bundling over from Gabriel Magalhães’s header following a Declan Rice corner to complete the rout against Atlético Madrid. On the sidelines, Arteta punched the air and motioned emphatically in the direction of his recent signing, of whom he has spent the previous 14 days insisting the finest displays lay ahead.

## Formative Hurdles
It was as a 14-year-old playing for IFK Aspudden-Tellus, who are located in Stockholm’s outskirts, that Gyökeres first realised he would have to develop a thick skin to thrive in his vocation. Admonished after a poor performance by a coach who said he lacked the mindset to succeed in top-level football, he ended up being converted from a winger into a striker after moving to Brommapojkarna two years later. “That one stuck with me and I recall it now,” he said not long ago.

## Testing Period
Goal-shy since the win over Nottingham Forest in London back on 13 September, this has been one of the hardest times of his time in football. Gyökeres was heavily criticised after Sweden were beaten by Kosovo and Switzerland in World Cup qualifiers in the past fortnight, with one newspaper describing his performance against the latter as “absent.”

He recorded an astounding 54 goals in 52 appearances across all competitions for Sporting last season, so the problem is obviously not his finishing. As Arteta has frequently pointed out, his overall contribution has added a new layer in attack, even if the opportunities have not come to him.

## Key Moments
This was clearly apparent during the initial 45 minutes of this top-level clash between two teams that had at first appeared well-balanced. There was a sense that Gyökeres was overexerting himself to make an impact as he charged around like a disruptive presence during the beginning phase. An Eberechi Eze shot that deflected on to the bar inside the initial stages was set up by some quick moves on the edge of the Atlético area that niftily took him away from his defender, José María Giménez.

The defender has the aura of a man who could start a fight in an empty bar but is highly seasoned at this stage compared with Gyökeres, who is participating in just his second Champions League campaign after netting three goals for Sporting against Manchester City last season that must have gone a long way to convincing Arteta to take the plunge.

## Relentless Effort
However having drawn comments that he was carrying a few too many pounds after being absent for preparations in Portugal, Arsenal’s much more svelte-looking striker pursued each opportunity as if his future was at stake. Giménez was fooled into conceding a caution when Gyökeres made contact on the edge of the Atlético area having merely stood his ground. Gabriel Martinelli saw his goal ruled out for offside after converting Bukayo Saka’s cross and it only came in the second half that the Swede had his opening chance.

A exquisite touch from Martinelli created an ideal chance, only for Jan Oblak to swiftly block an hesitant shot towards goal. At that stage it must have appeared that the opening goal would elude him. But the floodgates opened when Gabriel nodded in Rice’s free-kick and Gyökeres was able to take full advantage as the man in the mask left his imprint. “Hopefully this is the beginning of a great run,” said a delighted Arteta.
