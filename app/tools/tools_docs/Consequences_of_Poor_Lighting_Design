# What are the consequences of a poor lighting design?
Almost all of our bodily processes depend on the alternation between light and darkness – a stable circadian rhythm is therefore crucial for our well-being. However, there has been a tendency to underestimate and neglect this fundamental need when planning and implementing lighting in the buildings we frequent daily, and it has consequences. A lighting design that does not consider our natural light and dark needs is detrimental to our health.

## The Key to a Well-Functioning Brain
Our mental health relies heavily on receiving the right light at the right time and maintaining a strong circadian rhythm. We need the active and bright day and the dark and restful night to have a well-functioning brain and psyche. Consider the fatigue and sadness one can experience during the winter months when the sky is grey, the days are short, and the sun is scarce. Winter depression is a classic example of what a disrupted circadian rhythm can do to people, as research has shown that the lack of daylight is the direct cause of winter depression.

## The Consequences of Poor Lighting Design
A lack of natural daylight or exposure to the wrong light at the wrong time can disturb our internal clock, leading to:
* Insomnia or excessive sleepiness during the day
* Sleep problems associated with an increased risk of depression and dementia
* A poor lighting design, such as intense white light in the evening and at night, can inhibit the production of the hormone melatonin, disrupting the circadian rhythm and resulting in sleep and recovery problems, mood disturbances, and an increased risk of depression.

## The Dark Side of Light
Despite the growing focus on creating a healthy indoor environment, attention is often directed towards air quality and noise levels rather than lighting design. This is surprising considering the negative impact that poor lighting can have on our overall health. Our circadian rhythm forms the foundation of our well-being, and without a properly functioning rhythm, we simply cannot thrive.

## Physical Problems Caused by Poor Lighting
By being exposed to the wrong light at the wrong time, many of our bodily processes will be disturbed, put on hold, or completely thrown off rhythm and begin to counteract each other. This can lead to physical problems such as:
* A weakened immune system
* Obesity
* Diabetes
* Poor sleep
* Decreased muscle strength

## No Glare and Flicker
Light that produces glare or flickering can also have an impact on our well-being, causing:
* Psychological discomfort such as stress and irritability
* Physical discomfort in the form of eye strain and headaches

## Designing Thoughtful Lighting Environments
Lighting design is about much more than just aesthetics. It plays a crucial role in our mental and physical health. Without considering the importance of light for people in the built environment, we risk ending up with a poor lighting design that disrupts our circadian rhythm and becomes detrimental to our health.

## Recommendation for a Good Lighting Design
Our recommendation for a good lighting design is simple: ensure that the implemented lighting provides the right lighting at the right time - without glare and flickering - and make sure it is designed to support the specific needs of the users.
