The aura of your home is easily determined by the lighting setup. A generous amount of brightness, not too harsh, nor too dim, can create a calming effect. IKEA’s range of smart lighting lasts much longer than traditional light bulbs. They are also sustainable in the sense that they consume way less energy than your regular bulbs.

## Controlling Smart Lights
You can control smart lights for home from anywhere. Traditional light bulbs have switches to operate them, but smart lights can be controlled using an app. IKEA’s lighting range includes some of the most minimalistic models that are very easy to install.

## Efficiency of Smart LED Bulbs
Smart LED bulbs consume very little energy and can last much longer than traditional bulbs. The average life of these lights is somewhere around 23,000-25,000 hours. They are also more efficient and produce less heat, making them a green choice.

## Aesthetic Appeal of Smart Lighting
Smart lighting can transform the aesthetic of your home. IKEA’s wifi controlled lighting is pleasing to the eye and mind. The brightness isn’t harsh on the eyes and doesn’t overpower the room with its intensity.

## Centralised Control with Remote Control Bulbs
Connecting all your smart devices to the same network is very helpful and economical. You can change the colours, adjust the intensity, and even decide when the lights should switch off.

## Integrated Lighting for Various Setups
Integrated lighting can be used to create various setups, such as a home theatre, a quiet night’s sleep, or a late night study. IKEA’s LED lights and kits are perfect for these setups.

## Affordability of Smart Lighting
Although smart lighting is more energy efficient, aesthetically pleasing, and long lasting, it's still a cost-effective investment. IKEA’s smart lighting includes cabinet lights, LED bulbs, wifi controlled systems, and even lighting kits.

## Safety and Wellness with Smart LED Bulbs
Smart LED bulbs can provide safety and wellness benefits, such as motion sensing, adjustable colours, and improved sleep habits. They can also help improve your overall wellness by offering clever features.
