To enable AI summarization in your ticketing module, follow these simple steps:
1. Navigate to Settings > My MSP > MonicaAI.
2. Enable toggle switches for composing side conversation threads and ticket summaries.
📝 Note: SuperOps utilizes OpenAI for this feature, so occasional inaccuracies in results may occur. OpenAI does not utilize your data to train its models or enhance its services.

## Summarizing a Ticket

2. You’ll get a concise summary of the conversation history, eliminating the need to sift through lengthy exchanges. 
This summary can be viewed in either paragraph form or bullet points, facilitating quick comprehension of the scenario at hand.

## Adding Notes with AI
Save time and effort by incorporating AI-generated summaries directly into ticket conversations as notes. 
By clicking the Wand Icon within the notes section, you can easily insert the summarization for future reference.

## Composing Side Conversations with AI
