problem_statement: |
  In many outpatient clinics, administrative teams rely on spreadsheets and phone calls to coordinate appointment slots. This manual process forces staff to spend 5–8 hours each week reconciling schedules, while conflicts arise 3–4 times weekly, leading to double bookings and patient confusion. The workaround—manual updates and ad‑hoc phone calls—fails because it is error‑prone, time‑consuming, and does not provide real‑time visibility into doctor availability or patient preferences. The result is wasted staff time, diminished patient satisfaction, and lost revenue opportunities as appointments are missed or rescheduled.

  The core of the issue is the lack of an automated, intelligent system that can ingest doctor calendars, patient preferences, and clinic constraints to generate conflict‑free schedules. Without such a system, administrative staff must continuously juggle conflicting entries, and patients are left with unreliable booking information, further eroding trust in the clinic’s service.

  Addressing this root problem would streamline clinic operations, free up staff for higher‑value tasks, and improve the overall patient experience by ensuring appointments are scheduled accurately and transparently.

solutions: |
  The SmartMed Scheduler will deploy an AI‑driven scheduling engine that ingests doctor availability, clinic rules, and patient preferences to automatically assign appointment slots in real time. Patients will use a self‑service portal to view open slots and book appointments, while administrators will access a dashboard for oversight and manual overrides. The system will continuously monitor calendars for conflicts, trigger instant resolution workflows, and send automated reminders to both patients and staff. By replacing spreadsheets and phone calls with a unified, intelligent platform, the solution eliminates manual coordination, reduces scheduling conflicts, and frees administrative staff to focus on patient care.
